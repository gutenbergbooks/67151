<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The present treatise is intended to give what the author
has often felt the need of—a compact and thoroughly reliable
statement of the principal historical facts to the authenticity
and integrity of the New Testament writings concerning our
Lord, and the presumptions from them which establish his
claims as our Divine Redeemer and Saviour.</p>

<p>The question of his Resurrection from the dead is selected
as the pivot, because everything hinges upon it. This question,
whichever way it is determined, is decisive. It is a
question which greatly concerns every one. It is a question
of evidence, and as such is especially deserving of careful
inquiry by members of the legal profession. For, as Prof.
Greenleaf observed in his work hereafter cited,—“If a close
examination of the evidences of Christianity may be expected
of one class of men more than another, it would seem incumbent
on us, who make the law of evidence one of our peculiar
studies.”</p>

<p>As the question of Christ’s Resurrection is the objective
point of our inquiries, all other questions are subordinated
to it, and examined so far only as deemed material to the
main question.</p>

<p>The author has availed himself of a lawyer’s privilege, and
made use of the researches, arguments, and conclusions of
others who may justly be regarded as authority, and to
whom he has given credit as far as practicable, but has endeavored
to form an independent judgment in view of all
accessible sources of information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The work is, in the main, as published in a series of articles
in the <i>New Hampshire Journal</i>, and also in the <i>Vermont
Chronicle</i>, from March 5, 1881, to April 1, 1882, which will
explain the use of the common version in the earlier chapters
and the New Revision in the later ones.</p>

<p>While the proofs have been marshalled around the principal
fact, those to establish the subsidiary question of our
Four Gospels and the Book of Acts have been largely
centered upon the “Memoirs” mentioned in the confessedly
genuine writings of Justin Martyr. Justin, in his First
Apology, so called, written before the year one hundred and
fifty of our era, and probably ten years earlier, has given a
graphic account of the usages in the churches generally.
In this account he says that, on the “day called Sunday,”
Memoirs of Christ were read with the Prophets, in all their
assemblies. Hence, when it is ascertained that these Memoirs
were our Canonical Gospels, we make a long stride toward
the conclusion of their undoubted authenticity and genuineness.</p>

<p>To all questions of evidence which arise, the author applies
legal principles and presumptions derived from experience
and constantly acted upon in courts of justice. He asks of
the reader a patient perusal to the end, for he confidently
believes that the vital fact of Christ’s Resurrection, with all
the grand consequences which necessarily follow it, is as
susceptible of proof, from undoubted historical facts and solid
argument, as any other event in history.</p>

<p>The work is written for busy men in all the walks of life,
and the writer has endeavored to make himself understood.</p>

PROOFS OF CHRIST’S RESURRECTION.</h1>

<span class="smaller">SOURCES OF EVIDENCE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It is a characteristic of all who deny this and all other
miracles, that they beg the whole question to begin with.
They assume as an axiom that a miracle is impossible, or
impossible to be proved by human testimony. Or, to put it
more mildly, in the language of one of their number (Renan<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>),
“neither men of the people nor men of the world are competent
to prove it. Great precaution and a long habit of
scientific research are requisite.” If these are sound axioms,
it should be a matter of indifference who were the witnesses,
or what their credibility or means of knowledge, since at the
best they were but human, and it is not claimed that they
were experts or <i>savans</i> after the modern skeptical school,
although they might be expected to know whether one who
walked with them, and to whose instructions they listened,
and from whom they received their commission, were dead
or alive.</p>

<p>It is also a comfortable assumption on their part that no
one is a scholar who does not agree with their opinion, and
many young men who would not be thought to be behind the
times are misled by their confident boasting. “No modern
theologian,” says Strauss,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “who is also a scholar, now considers
any of the four Gospels to be the work of its pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
author, or in fact to be by an Apostle or colleague of an
Apostle.” The logic of this is, that if any one does so
consider them, he is not a scholar. The same kind of
scholarship and habit of thinking that induced this wise
conclusion brought him at last to the denial of the existence
of a personal God or a future life. His experience is instructive,
and shows the inevitable tendency of all reasoning that
denies the possibility of a miracle or a divine revelation.
Mill’s hard logic cannot well be resisted. “Once admit a
God, and the production, by his direct volition, of an effect
which in any case owed its origin to his creative will, is no
more a purely arbitrary hypothesis to account for the past,
but must be reckoned with as a serious possibility.” If, then,
a miracle may occur, it may be proved<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> by human testimony,
for the very motive or reason for its occurrence, or, at least
the principal reason, must be its value as an attestation.</p>

<p>And the immense labor which the Tübingen school and
every class of skeptics have bestowed in attempts to disprove
the authorship of the Four Gospels, shows that they have not
much confidence in their axioms after all. Why so anxious as
to the witnesses, if it is immaterial who they are, or what
they testify to? If a miracle cannot be proved by <i>any</i>
evidence, why have they multiplied books to prove or disprove
the authorship of the gospels?</p>

<h3>THE BEST EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>The best evidence of which the subject admits, is all that
is required in courts; and it is sufficient in matters of the
highest concern, even in cases of life and death, that a fact
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The best evidence to
Christ’s disciples of his resurrection, was that of their own
senses. This evidence we cannot have. We are in the
position, in some respects, of jurors, who must decide not
from their own knowledge, but upon the testimony of others.
We have not, however, the witnesses upon the stand, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
only what may be regarded as their depositions, and it is
made a question whether the writings produced are their
depositions.</p>

<p>The question, then, in this stage is, who were the writers
of the Four Gospels and the book of Acts? As to the latter,
the writer claims to have written a former treatise, and it
seems to be taken by both parties to the controversy, that
the same person (whoever he was) wrote both books, so that
any evidence of Luke’s authorship of the third Gospel, is
evidence of his authorship of Acts, and <i>vice versa</i>. And the
same is true in respect to the Fourth Gospel and the First
Epistle of John.</p>

<p>The best evidence as to the authorship of any of these
books which the nature of the subject admits of, is from history
and tradition, including in these terms quotations,
citations, harmonies, commentaries, translations, and manuscripts.</p>

<p>There are two modes of presenting this evidence. One is
to begin with their present acknowledged acceptance, and
ascend the stream; the other is to strike tributaries, as near
their source as we are able, and descend to the river. The
latter will be adopted here in the first instance, and ultimately
both modes of proof.</p>

<h3>LOST TRIBUTARIES.</h3>

<p>One hundred years from the crucifixion, churches had been
established in all the cities and in many of the villages of the
Roman Empire, from Cappadocia and Pontus on the east, to
Gaul on the west, and Christians were very numerous.
Tacitus describes those at Rome at the time of Nero’s
barbarity, as “a great multitude,” and Pliny, in his letter
to Trajan, <i>cir.</i> A.D. 110, affirms that the heathen temples
were almost deserted, so that the sacred victims scarcely
found any purchasers, and that the “superstition,” as he
termed it, not only infected the cities, but had even spread
into the villages, of Pontus and Bithynia (Gibbon, p. 576).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Hence persons unacquainted with the subject might suppose
that it would be easy to adduce abundant proof from writers
of the first century, as to what memoirs of our Lord, if any,
were in the churches at the time Pliny wrote his celebrated
letter. Such, however, is not the fact.</p>

<p>There is no <i>direct</i> historical testimony known to be
earlier than the first apology<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of Justin Martyr to the
Roman Emperor, <i>cir.</i> A.D. 139. There are certain fragments
written by Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis, which
may be of an earlier date, but this is uncertain. There
are also quotations apparently from the third and fourth
Gospels, by Basilides,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the Gnostic heretic who flourished
at Alexandria as early as A.D. 125. There is an epistle
to the Philippian church, attributed to Polycarp which
Dean Stanley thinks dates about A.D. 130. Its genuineness
is not universally admitted. There is an epistle,
conceded to be genuine, from the church at Rome to the
church at Corinth, of the probable date of A.D. 95. There
are epistles attributed by some to Ignatius, who suffered
martyrdom, <i>cir.</i> A.D. 107, but their genuineness is controverted.
There are in addition three other writings known as
the Epistle of Barnabas, the Letter to Diognetus, and the
Pastor Hermas. They are by unknown authors, and of
uncertain date, but were probably written in the latter part
of the first or the first part of the second century.</p>

<p>And these are all that have come down to us in any form
from the first one hundred years after the crucifixion. That
we have no more is easily explained. This period was one of
intense activity and violent persecutions. Five (as some
reckon them) of the ten general persecutions were within<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
this period. The first was under Nero, A.D. 64, the second
under Domitian, A.D. 95, the third under Trajan, A.D. 100,
the fourth under Antoninus the Philosopher, and the fifth
under Severus, A.D. 127; and, as some of these continued
several years, there was scarcely an intermission for three-quarters
of a century. The horrible tortures and cruel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
deaths under Nero are well-known, and, under Domitian,
forty thousand were supposed to have suffered martyrdom.</p>

<p>It is no matter of surprise, therefore, that so little has
reached us from this early period. Christians were making
history, not writing it, and of their writings the most
perished. There were hundreds and thousands who well
knew what memoirs of our Lord were accepted by the
churches in this period, from whose lips no voice comes
except in the volume of universal tradition.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[3]</a> A.D. 138 or 139 is the date most usually assigned to this most important
work, although some place it as late as A.D. 150. If his statement
in it that “Christ was born 150 years ago” were to be taken strictly, it
would make its date A.D. 146 or A.D. 144, according as we allow four or
six years as the error for the beginning of the true Christian era; but he
may have used the number in a general way. His martyrdom is variously

<span class="smaller">ADMISSIONS AND PRESUMPTIONS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>With the somewhat scanty and inconclusive evidence
from writings of the first one hundred years from the crucifixion,
are there any facts that are conceded, and any presumptions
from them? There are concessions, and from
what motives is immaterial, since there is no doubt of the
existence of the facts that are admitted even by those who
deny the authenticity of the Gospels. Says Renan<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: “Not
the slightest doubt has been raised by serious criticism
against the authenticity of the Epistle to the Galatians, the
two Epistles to the Corinthians, or the Epistle to the
Romans; while the arguments on which are founded the
attacks on the two Epistles to the Thessalonians, and that to
the Philippians, are without value.” And it may be added
that the genuineness of the Book of Revelations is conceded
and insisted upon by most of his way of thinking.</p>

<p>Now, from the four Epistles against whose authenticity “not
the slightest doubt has been raised by serious criticism,” and
the writings of Josephus, Tacitus and Pliny, these facts are
as well established as any facts of history can possibly be
established:—Jesus Christ was born in Judea in the days of
Herod, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate. He was a
most extraordinary character, and a wonderful teacher. He
gathered disciples, of whom twelve were called Apostles.
After his death, his followers were formed into numerous
churches, which, in a few years, extended into all parts of the
then known world, and of which there has been a continuous
succession till now. If, from their disciples, we know something
of the life and teachings of Confucius and Socrates, we
should expect as much concerning him whose advent revolutionized
the world, within three centuries overturned the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
pagan superstitions throughout the Roman Empire, and is
still the greatest moral power of the most enlightened nations
of the earth. But, if there were any accepted memoirs of
him in that first hundred years from his crucifixion, what has
become of them? It is incredible that they should have
dropped out of existence and there be no history or tradition
of it. It is incredible that they should have been lost
to churches having a continuous life, or that others should
have been substituted for them, and there be no trace
of their disappearance or of a substitution. In the
churches in every period, the old and the young were
together. How, then, was displacement and substitution
possible without protest? How was the loss of accepted
memoirs possible, so long as there was a continued succession
of teachers? Yet none have reached our time other than
those which have come to us through all the centuries as
authentic writings of those whose names they bear.</p>

<p>By the law of the “survival of the fittest,” all other productions
making any pretensions to such a character perished
long ago, only fragments of them remain, and our four Gospels
are in the churches. There is, therefore, to begin with,
the strongest presumption in their favor. “It is,” says
Professor Greenleaf,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “for the objector to show them spurious;
for on him, by the plainest rules of law, lies the burden
of proof.” And from what has appeared it is plain that this
“burden” is a very heavy one.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">PAPIAS AND JUSTIN MARTYR.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The fact of the early reception, by the churches, of
Memoirs of Christ deemed authentic, probable in itself without
any proof, is conclusively proved by writings and to which
reference has been made, particularly those of Papias and
Justin Martyr.</p>

<p>Papias was bishop of Hierapolis, in Phrygia, in the first
part of the second century of the Christian era. Though of
moderate capacity, and entertaining extravagant ideas of the
millennium, he was entirely honest, and there is no reason to
question his testimony as to what he was told in respect to
Matthew and Mark. He suffered martyrdom about A.D.
163. From fragments of his writings found in Eusebius and
in the works of Irenæus, it appears that “John the Presbyter”
gave him information in respect to the First and Second
Gospels.</p>

<p>There is a difference of opinion as to whether this John
was John the Apostle. Eusebius held that he was not, and
says that in his day (264-340) there were two tombs at Ephesus,
both of which were called John’s. The question of identity
is not very material. Papias gives, in explanation, that
he imagined that “what was to be got from books” concerning
the Lord, was not as profitable to him “as what
came from the living and abiding voice.” For this reason,
he says, “If, then, any one who had attended on the elders
came, I asked minutely after their sayings, what Andrew or
Peter said, or what was said by Philip, or by Thomas, or by
James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any other of the
Lord’s disciples,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which things Aristion and the Presbyter
John, the disciples of the Lord, say.”</p>

<p>From this, it is plain there were then accredited “books”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
concerning our Lord. And two of these books are identified
by his statement of what he was told by John the Presbyter,
that “Mark, having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote
down accurately whatever he remembered of Peter’s instructions,”
whom he accompanied (it was not, however, in exact
order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ), “and
Matthew put together the oracles in the Hebrew language,
and each one interpreted them as best he could.”
These extracts prove that the First and Second Gospels were
extant, not only when Papias wrote, and when the Presbyter
gave him the information, but also some time before. His
informant, if <i>not</i> John the Apostle, must have been one who
had seen the Apostles or some of them, so that the testimony
is very direct.</p>

<p>That Papias does not mention Luke’s Gospel, or John’s
Gospel, proves nothing except that he had no occasion to say
anything about them, in that connection. The Fourth Gospel
may not have been <i>written</i> at the time of the interview
with the Presbyter, for the Apostle John lived until about the
year 100, and he wrote his Gospel very late in life. It is not
quoted by Clement.</p>

<p>And as to the Third Gospel, the occasion for the writing of
it is distinctly stated by the author himself, who was well
known. And so of the Fourth Gospel; its authorship modestly
but clearly appears upon its face. We have mere fragments
from Papias not exceeding two or three hundred lines
all told. In some of his five books (almost the whole of which
have been lost) there may have been references to both Luke
and John. Eusebius<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> states that Papias made use of testimonials
from the First Epistle of John; but as he does not
say that Papias ascribed that Epistle to John, his use of it
only proves that it was extant when he wrote. There is,
however, a quotation in one of these fragments (v), “In my
Father’s house are many mansions,” which is literally as in
John xiv. 2, and so, presumptively, was taken from it. It is
an interesting fact that the only <i>quotations</i> other than this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
by Papias (if those in this fragment are indeed by him), are
as in verses 25 to 28 of the 15th of First Corinthians, a
chapter which will be found to have great weight in another
part of this discussion.</p>

<p>Papias, therefore, probably<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> quotes the Fourth Gospel. But,
without such quotation, no inference could be drawn against
Luke or John from mere silence. Papias would still prove
the First and Second Gospels, leaving the Third and Fourth to
stand upon the presumption in their favor stated in our last
chapter, and upon positive evidence from other sources.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[1]</a> The quotations from Papias are from Vol. I, of the Ante-Nicene
Christian Library, translated by Rev. Alexander Roberts, D.D., and James
Donaldson, LL.D.; and so in respect to any of the Apostolic Fathers.
The editors say the words, “Which things, <i>etc.</i>,” are usually translated,
“What Aristion and John say,” and that such translation is admissible,
but that they more naturally mean that John and Aristion, even at the time
of Justin’s writing, were telling him of the sayings of the Lord.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[2]</a> Eusebius B. III., c. 39.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[3]</a> The editors call it “mere guess-work” (Ante-Nicene Christian Library,
Vol. I., p. 444, note). Eusebius makes no mention of it, though his
silence is not conclusive against it.</p>

<p>The question is of sufficient importance to warrant the giving of the entire
passage from Irenæus in which the quotations appear. It is the last
of five short chapters of his work on Heresies. Certain passages are
printed in italics, which the reader is specially asked to consider: “As
the <i>presbyters</i> say, then those who were deemed worthy of an abode in
heaven shall go there, others shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, and others
shall possess the splendor of the city, for everywhere the Saviour will
be seen, according as they shall be worthy who see Him. But there is
this distinction between the habitation of those who produce an hundred-fold,
and those who produce sixty-fold, and who produce thirty-fold;
for the first will be taken up into the heavens, the second class will dwell
in Paradise, and the last will inhabit the city; and that on this account
the Lord said, ‘In my Father’s house are many mansions;’ for all things
belong to God, who supplies all with a suitable dwelling-place, even as
His word says, that a share is given to all by the Father, according as
each one is or shall be worthy. And this is the couch in which they shall
recline who feast, being invited to the wedding. <i>The Presbyters, the disciples
of the Apostles</i>, say that this is the gradation and arrangement of
those who are saved, and that they advance through steps of this nature;
and that, moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and
through the Son to the Father; and that in due time the Son will yield up
His work to the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, ‘For He must
reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is death.’ For in the times of the kingdom the just
man who is on the earth shall forget to die. But when He saith all
things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did put
all things under Him. And when all things shall be subdued unto Him,
then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things
under Him, that the Son may be all in all.” There being no question of
the genuineness of this passage from Irenæus, by whom were the quotations,
found in it? Now while it is possible they were by <i>Irenæus</i>, to illustrate
what ‘the Presbyters, the disciples of the Apostles,’ maintained,
the more obvious and natural interpretation is, that they were cited by those
Presbyters themselves. This being so, it is not of much consequence
whether Irenæus had this information of these views and citations, from
Papias (from whom he had obtained like information upon other subjects
as to the sayings of the Presbyters), or whether Irenæus had this information
of their sayings from other sources. In either event the quotations
were made <i>either</i> by Papias, his contemporaries, or predecessors, “disciples
of the Apostles.” And of this opinion are Charteris (Canonicity,
c. 17, of the Introduction), and Routh, Tischendorf, Wescott, Dorner and
Riggenback, as cited in “Supernatural Religion” p. 604.</p>

<p>Great importance attaches to them in connection with
other facts.</p>

<p>The date of Justin’s birth is uncertain, being placed as
early as A.D. 85, and as late as A.D. 114; Rev. Mr. Wright
says about A.D. 100. His martyrdom was about A.D. 165.
His father and grandfather were probably of Roman origin.
Before his conversion to Christianity, he studied in the
schools of the philosophers, but after that he became an
Evangelist, and a vigorous writer in defence of the Christian
faith. It is probable that he travelled much. He was not
the first that wrote an Apology for Christians, but his are the
earliest extant. Besides these, he wrote a much larger work
(the Dialogue with Trypho, a Jew), a work on the resurrection,
and some others; and by some, he has been regarded
as the author of the Pastor Hermas. His first and principal
Apology, of the probable date of A.D. 138-9, was addressed
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To the Emperor Titus Ælius Adrianus Antoninus Pius Augustus
Cæsar, and to his son Verissimus, the philosopher, and to
Lucius, the philosopher, the natural son of Cæsar, and the
adopted son of Pius, a lover of learning, and to the Sacred Senate,
with the whole people of the Romans, I, Justin, the son of Priscus
and grandson of Bacchius, native of Flavia Neapolis in Palestine,
present this address and petition in behalf of those of all nations
who are unjustly hated and wantonly abused, myself being one
of them.”</p>

</div>

<p>Those to whom this formal address was made, would not
be expected to know anything about Matthew, Mark, Luke,
or John; but it was otherwise, in respect to the Old Testament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
for Jewish synagogues were in every city, and the Septuagint
had been known for three hundred years.</p>

<p>In this Apology he explains some of the teachings of our
Lord, and the usages of his disciples; and in respect to the
last, are these passages:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the Apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which
are called Gospels, have thus delivered unto us what was enjoined
upon them; that Jesus took bread and when he had given thanks
said, ‘This do ye in remembrance of me, this is my body;’ and
that, after the same manner having taken the cup and given
thanks, he said, ‘This is my blood;’ and he gave it to them
alone.”... “And we afterwards continually remind each
other of these things. And the wealthy among us help the needy;
and we always keep together; and for all things wherewith we
are supplied, we bless the Maker of all, through his Son Jesus
Christ, and through the Holy Ghost. And on the day called
Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together
to one place, and the Memoirs of the Apostles or the writings of
the Prophets are read, as long as time permits; then when the
reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts
to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together
and pray, and as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread
and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner
offers prayers and thanksgivings according to his ability, and the
people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each,
and a participation of that over which thanks have been given,
and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons.
And they who are well-to-do, and willing, give what each thinks fit;
and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succors
the orphans and widows, and those who, through sickness or any
other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds, and the
strangers sojourning among us, and in a word, takes care of all
who are in need. But Sunday is the day on which we all hold
our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God,
having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the
world; and Jesus Christ, our Saviour, on the same day rose from
the dead. For he was crucified on the day before that of Saturn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
(Saturday): and on the day after that of Saturn, which is the
day of the Sun, having appeared to his apostles and disciples,
he taught them these things, which we have submitted to you also
for your consideration.”</p>

</div>

<p>This passage is a part of chapter sixty-six, and the whole of
chapter sixty-seven.</p>

<p>The great question is, What were these “Memoirs of the
Apostles,” which were thus read with the writings of the
Prophets? It is a question of interpretation.</p>

<p>By the rule adopted in courts, these words are to be construed
with the context, and in connection with other writings
of Justin in relation to the same subject, and also in the
light of all the surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p>These precise terms are first used in chapter sixty-seven.
The same Memoirs, evidently, in chapter sixty-six, are described
as Memoirs “composed” by the Apostles. They
are not again referred to in this Apology. They are referred
to several times in the Dialogue, chapters one hundred
to one hundred and eight, by the following terms: The Memoirs
of His Apostles; The Memoirs of His Apostles; The
Memoirs of His Apostles; The Memoirs of the Apostles;
<i>For in the Memoirs which I say were drawn up by his Apostles
and those who followed them</i>; The Memoirs of His Apostles;
The Memoirs; The Memoirs; The Memoirs; The Memoirs
of the Apostles; The Memoirs of Him; The Memoirs of His
Apostles; The Memoirs. Four times he calls them The
Memoirs; three times The Memoirs of the Apostles; five
times The Memoirs of His Apostles; and once, The Memoirs
of Him, <i>i. e.</i>, Christ, as Roberts and Donaldson interpret it,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and as the context and the whole scope indicate.</p>

<p>It is plain that the same “Memoirs” are intended throughout,
under these various terms.</p>

<p>In chapter eighty-eight of the Dialogue, in mentioning the
descent of the Holy Ghost upon Jesus at his baptism, Justin
says that when he came out of the water, the Holy Ghost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
lighted on him like a dove, as “the Apostle of this very
Christ of ours wrote.” The incident is mentioned in all
four of the Gospels.</p>

<p>But for his explanation elsewhere, it would be inferred that
<i>all</i> the “Memoirs” were “composed” by the Apostles. But
he carefully explains his meaning, so that the “Memoirs,” or
some of them, may have been “drawn up” either by the
Apostles, or by those who followed them.</p>

<p>It is obvious that these Memoirs were not biographies or
sketches by unknown or irresponsible persons, but writings
well understood by the Churches to have been “composed”
or “drawn up” by the Apostles, or with their approval.</p>

<p>As Mark was understood to be Peter’s interpreter, so Luke
was understood to have been Paul’s companion, and to have
written under his sanction. And Paul was an Apostle, although
not one of the twelve.</p>

<p>Justin had informed the Roman Emperor<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the Apostles,
and he gave like information to Trypho.<a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He meant that all
who should read should know that what he gave of the life
and teachings of Christ was not from irresponsible sources,
but from writings expressly sanctioned, if not actually written,
by those whom Christ had selected as witnesses.</p>

<p>These Memoirs, therefore, were doubtless understood <i>by
Justin, and by the church in general</i>, in city and country, to
have been the productions of Apostles or their companions.
They were read the same as the Prophets, and placed upon
the same footing. Justin, in writing to Trypho, speaks of
having believed <span class="smcap">God’s voice spoken by the apostles of
Christ</span>.</p>

<p>And since, in speaking of their actual composition, he uses
the plural, “Apostles,” we should look for two or more Memoirs,
“drawn up,” by Apostles.</p>

<p>Now what were these Memoirs? What writings will answer
the description? Matthew<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Mark will, according
to what the Presbyter said of them. Were there any others?
There should be one more at least, that was written by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Apostle, else wherefore, the <i>plural</i>? The four Gospels that
have come down to us, answer the description in every particular.
To use a legal phrase,—“From the time whereof
the memory of man runneth not to the contrary,” two of
them have been accepted in the Church as having been composed
by Apostles, and two, by companions of Apostles.</p>

<p>Unless it can be shown that when Justin wrote, there were
<i>other</i> Memoirs of Christ <i>that will answer to his description</i>,
our four Gospels and no others were intended. <i>Were</i> there
any besides these?</p>

<span class="smaller">QUOTATIONS AND CITATIONS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The <i>apparent</i> or seeming use of our Gospels by Justin and
his contemporaries is a fact of great weight in determining
whether they are the “Memoirs” referred to by him.</p>

<p>According to the Indexes of Texts by the learned editors
of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library, John’s Gospel is
quoted or cited, twice in Barnabas, once in Diognetus, twice
in Hermas, once by Justin, and once by Papias. Mark is
quoted or cited, once in Barnabas, twice by Clement, three
times by Justin, and once by Polycarp: Acts is quoted or
cited once in Barnabas, once by Clement, once by Justin, and
four times by Polycarp: Luke is quoted or cited three times
in Barnabas, three times by Clement, once in Hermas, fourteen
times by Justin, and twice by Polycarp: and Matthew is
quoted or cited six times in Barnabas, five times by Clement,
twice in Diognetus, nine times in Hermas, forty-seven times
by Justin, and seven times by Polycarp.</p>

<p>As to <i>citations</i>, passages deemed such by one, may have
been overlooked or regarded differently by another, so that
there is not an entire agreement as to the number of citations,
<i>i. e.</i> of allusions or references that are not quotations.
And it should be understood that in the <i>quotations</i>, the
books from which they are taken are not stated, except
that Justin indicates that <i>his</i>, in general, are from the
“Memoirs.” Their agreement with our Gospels is sometimes
literally exact, quite often it is otherwise; and not
unfrequently two or three passages are seemingly blended,
as if the author were quoting from memory and giving the
sense, merely.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient for the purposes of the argument to give
examples (except as to the Fourth Gospel) only from Justin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
and to omit <i>his</i> quotations from Matthew and Mark, since
they are so numerous and not a few of them of considerable
length. Of his references, Rev. Mr. Wright says<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: “Upon
examination it is found that of the one hundred and twenty
or more allusions which Justin makes to the Gospel history,
nearly all coincide as to substance with the statements of
either Matthew or Luke. Of the sixty or seventy apparently
direct quotations, ten are exact, twenty-five are only slightly
variant, while there are thirty-two in which the variation is
considerable. But in respect to variations from the original
in quotation, it should be remembered that familiarity often
leads to carelessness with regard to minute points. Justin,
himself, out of one hundred and sixty-two quotations from
the Old Testament, has only sixty-four exact, while forty-four
are slightly variant, and fifty-four decidedly so.”</p>

<p>If the reader, with the New Testament in hand, will make
a comparison in the examples which will be given, he can
form his own judgment, which it is conceived, will be no
doubtful one. The substantial agreement is very striking even
when the language is not identical.</p>

<p>The first three are parts of long quotations from the Sermon on
the Mount, principally as in Matthew (Ap. cc. 15, 16) Luke vi.:
28, 29, and Matthew vi.: 7, 8, 13.</p>

<p>4. “We are persuaded that every man ... will render
account according to the power he has received from God, as
Christ intimated when he said, ‘To whom God has given more,
of him shall more be required.’” (Ap. c. 17.) Luke xv. 48.</p>

<p>5. “And the angel of God who was sent to the same virgin at
that time brought her good news, saying, ‘Behold, thou shalt
conceive of the Holy Ghost, and shall bear a son, and he shall be
called the Son of the Highest. And thou shalt call his name
Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins,’ <i>as they who
have recorded<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> all that concerns our Saviour Jesus Christ have

<p>6. “As our Lord himself says, ‘He that heareth me, heareth
him that sent me.’” (Ap. c. 63.) Luke x. 16.</p>

<p>7. “And again in other words he said, ‘I give unto you power
to tread on serpents, and on scorpions and on scolopendras, and
on all the might of the enemy.’” (Dial. c. 76.) Luke x. 19.</p>

<p>8. “For he exclaimed before his crucifixion: ‘The Son of
Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the scribes and
pharisees and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’”
(Dial. c. 76.) Luke ix. 22.</p>

<p>9. “Just as our Lord also said: ‘They shall neither marry nor
be given in marriage, but shall be equal to the angels, the children
of the God of the resurrection.’” (Dial. c. 81.) Luke xx. 35, 36.</p>

<p>10. “For he taught us to pray for our enemies also, saying,
‘Love your enemies; be kind and merciful as your heavenly
Father’ is, for we see that the Almighty God is kind and merciful,
causing his sun to rise on the unthankful and on the righteous,
and sending rain on the holy and on the wicked.” (Dial. c. 96.)
Luke vi. 35, and Matthew v. 45.</p>

<p>11. “But the Virgin Mary received faith and joy, when the
angel Gabriel announced the good tidings to her that the Spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>

<p>12. “For when Christ was giving up his spirit on the cross he
said: ‘Father, unto thy hands I commend my spirit,’ <i>as I have
learned also from the Memoirs</i>.” (Dial. c. 105.) Luke xxiii. 46.</p>

<p>13. “He says, ‘The children of this world marry and are

marry nor are given in marriage, but shall be like the angels in
heaven.’” (Res., c. 3.) Luke xx. 34, 35.</p>

<p>14. “And wishing to confirm this, when his disciples did not
know whether to believe he had truly risen in the body, and were
looking upon him and doubting, he said to them, ‘Ye have not
yet faith, see that it is I,’ and he let them handle him, and
showed them the prints of the nails in his hands. And when
they were by every kind of proof persuaded that it was himself
and in the body, they asked him to eat with them, that they might
thus still more accurately ascertain that he had in verity risen
bodily; and he did eat honeycomb and fish. And when he had
thus shown them that there is truly a resurrection of the flesh, and
wishing to show them this also, that it is not impossible for flesh
to ascend into heaven (as he had said that our dwelling place is
in heaven). ‘He was taken up into heaven while they beheld,’ as
he was in the flesh.” (Res., c. 9.) Luke xxiv. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,
43, and Acts i. 9.</p>

</div>

<p>Before presenting Justin, from the Fourth Gospel, the use
of this Gospel by his contemporaries will be considered.</p>

<p>In <i>Barnabas</i> (c. 6) it is said that “He was to be manifested
in flesh and to sojourn among us.” (Com. John i. 14.) It
is also said in c. 12, in effect, that the brazen serpent was a
type of Jesus. (Com. John iii. 14-18.) Another passage in
c. 7, although not cited by the editors, is, “Because they shall
see him then in that day having a scarlet robe about his body
down to his feet; and they shall say, ‘is not this he whom we
once despised and <i>pierced</i> and mocked and crucified?’” This
<i>may</i> have had reference to what is recorded only in John, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Apollinaris,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> bishop of Hierapolis (<i>cir.</i> A.D. 170), afterward
wrote: “The Son of God, <i>pierced</i> in the sacred side, who
shed forth from his side the two things again cleansing,
water and blood, word and spirit.”</p>

<p>In <i>Diognetus</i>, c. 6, it is said that “Christians dwell in the
world yet are not of the world.” (Com. John xvii. 11, 14, 16.)
In c. 11 it is said, “This is he who was from the beginning”
(Com. John i. 1); and in the same chapter, “For who that is
rightly taught and begotten by the loving Word, would not
seek to know accurately the things which have been clearly
shown by the Word to his disciples, to whom the Word
being manifested has revealed them.” (Com. John i. 14, 18.)
There is but a single <i>quotation</i> in this eloquent Letter, which
is as in First Corinthians viii. 1, “Knowledge puffeth up,
but love edifieth.”</p>

<p>John alone speaks of Christ as the <i>door</i>, but the figure is
often used in <i>Hermas</i>, as, “You saw, he added, the multitude
who were building the tower? I saw them, sir, I said.
Those, he said, are all glorious angels, and by them accordingly
is the Lord surrounded. And the gate is the Son of
God. This is the one entrance to the Lord. In no other
way, then, shall any one enter into him except through his
Son.” (Simil. ix. 12.) John x. This book of Hermas is an
allegory in which an angel, in the guise of a shepherd, gives
instruction in the doctrines and duties that were held and
required by the Church. It has not a single <i>quotation</i> from
either the Old or New Testament. But as Dr. Chartris in
“Canonicity” (p. 137) well says: “The dignity, mission, and
sufferings of God’s Son are prominent in Hermas’ teaching,
and remind us of the Fourth Gospel at every turn.”</p>

<p>The supposed quotation by Papias, Fragment 5 (found in
Irenæus), “In my Father’s house are many mansions,” has
been given in a previous chapter.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><i>Basilides</i>, according to Hippolytus, used as proof-texts the
exact passages found in John i. 9 and John ii. 4. Hippolytus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
first records the comments of Basilides on the sentence
in Genesis, <i>Let there be light</i>, and then proceeds as follows:
“And this, he says, is what is said in the Gospels, ‘The true
light which lighteth every man which cometh into the world.’
And that each thing, he says, has its own seasons, the Saviour
is a sufficient witness when he says, ‘My hour is not yet
come.’” Those who deny that these quotations<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> were by
Basilides, claim that Hippolytus sometimes mixes up the opinions
of the master of a school with those of his followers,
and so it is not certain that Basilides used these texts. The
learned author of “Canonicity,” recently published, p. 173, declares
that the difficulties in the way of ascribing those quotations
to any other than Basilides, are “enormous.” The reasoning
of Matthew Arnold (who is quite far from being rigidly orthodox)
is so conclusive that we give the substance of it: “If
we take all the doubtful cases of the kind and compare them
with our present case, we shall find that it is not one of them.
It is not true that here where the name of Basilides has just
come before, and where no mention of his son or of his disciples
has intervened since, there is any such ambiguity as is
found in other cases.... The author in general uses the
formula, <i>according to them</i>, when he quotes from the school,
and the formula, <i>he says</i>, when he gives the dicta of the
Master. And in this particular case he manifestly quotes the
dicta of Basilides, and no one who had not a theory to serve
would ever dream of doubting it. Basilides, therefore, about
the year one hundred and twenty-five of our own era, had before
him the Fourth Gospel.”</p>

<p><i>The Epistles of Ignatius</i>, whether the longer or shorter or
Syriac, may be of too doubtful genuineness, or rather, the
extent as to which they are genuine is too doubtful to be
relied upon, although some of them contain numerous quotations.</p>

<span class="smaller">JUSTIN’S USE OF THE FOURTH GOSPEL.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Christ’s pre-existence, not declared in the other Gospels, is
frequently referred to by Justin.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> John alone calls Jesus the
Word; Justin often refers to him as such. Justin regards
the elevation of the brazen serpent in the wilderness as typical<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
of the crucifixion. He says it denoted salvation to those
who flee for refuge to him who sent his crucified son into the
world; the idea of God’s sending his Son into the world is
peculiar to John. The descent of the Holy Spirit in the form
of a dove, at the baptism of Jesus, is mentioned only in the
First and Fourth Gospels. Justin (Dial. c. 88) says that when
Jesus “came out of the water, the Holy Ghost lighted on
him like a dove, <i>as the Apostles of this very Christ of ours
wrote</i>.” Justin (Dial. c. 88) cites, as the words of John the
Baptist, “I am not the Christ, but the voice of one crying.”</p>

<p>This declaration, “I am not the Christ,” and this application
to himself of the language of Isaiah, are attributed to the
Baptist only in John (John i. 20, 23, and iii. 28). Hilgenfeld,
the latest representative of the Tübingen skeptical
school, recognizes<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> here the use of the Fourth Gospel by
Justin. And Dr. Ezra Abbot, following Professor Drummond,
gives twenty<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> instances (including the express quotation)
of the apparent or seeming use of this Gospel by
Justin.</p>

<p><i>The express quotation</i> as in John iii. 3, 5, is as follows:
“For Christ also said, ‘Except ye be born again ye shall not
enter into the kingdom of heaven.’ Now, that it is impossible
for those who have once been born to enter into their
mothers’ womb is manifest to all.” (Ap. c. 61.) This is as
translated in the Ante-Nicene Christian Library. Dr. Abbot
(p. 29) translates it “Except ye be born again, ye shall in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.” Matthew Arnold,
“Except ye be born again ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven.” Our common version is, “Except a man be
born again he cannot see the kingdom of God;” and in verse
5, “Except a man be born of water and the Spirit he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.” The revised version, “Except
a man be born anew,” or “from above” (margin), “he
cannot see the kingdom of God.” There is a <i>substantial</i>
agreement in the quotation with John’s Gospel, and unmistakable
reference to the interview with Nicodemus, which is
found only in John. The most <i>rational</i> inference is that it
was from that source.</p>

<p>Justin, in this quotation, was as definite as when (Ap. c. 32)
he wrote: “Moses then, who was the first of the prophets,
spake in these very words, ‘The sceptre shall not depart
from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until he
come for whom it is reserved; and he shall be the desire
of the nations, binding his foal to the vine, washing his
robe in the blood of the grape.’” (Com. Gen. xlix. 10, 11.)
He does not state <i>where</i> the passage is to be found, and its
divergence from Genesis is greater than the difference in the
language of Jesus, as quoted by Justin and recorded by John.</p>

<p>Justin, in quoting from the Old Testament, usually gives
the <i>name</i> of the prophet, <i>but nothing more</i>; just as he gives
this quotation as the language of Christ. He writes <i>Moses
said</i>, or <i>Isaiah said</i>, and he also writes <i>Christ said</i>.</p>

<p>The other Apostolic Fathers, in their quotations from the Old
Testament, do not usually give the name of the prophet, but
only, “It is written,” “God said,” “The Spirit saith,” “The
Scripture saith,” and often only “saith,” “The Scripture” in
such cases being implied. And, as a rule, they do not quote
with literal accuracy or a near approximation to it.</p>

<p>It has been objected, that if this quotation was actually
from the Fourth Gospel, more than a single quotation from it
should be expected. Let this be tested by the four epistles
confessed to be genuine. There is not a single quotation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
by Justin from <i>either</i> of these acknowledged epistles, and it
is doubtful if there is a single reference to them, certainly not
in his Apology.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. The epistle to the Galatians (and Renan
says, “Thanks to the Epistle to the Galatians!”) is not referred
to in any way by Clement, or in Barnabas, or Hermas;
nor First Corinthians in Barnabas or Hermas (and but
once in Diognetus); nor Romans in Hermas; nor Revelation
in Barnabas, or Diognetus, or Polycarp, and but once by
Clement.</p>

<p>To account for Justin’s silence, it has been imagined, without
the slightest evidence, that Justin was “anti-Pauline.”
But how are the omissions by other writers to be accounted
for? How did it happen that Clement made no reference to
Galatians? It was not from hostility, certainly, for he speaks
of “The blessed Apostle Paul.” Yet writing this epistle
from the church at Rome, to the church at Corinth, he has
but a single quotation from Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, and
but a single quotation from Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians,
and <i>no</i> reference to Galatians.</p>

<p>The well-known distinction of everyday application in
courts of law and elsewhere, between positive and negative
evidence, is to be kept in mind. Whether John’s Gospel
would be quoted by any writer acquainted with it, might depend
entirely upon his object in writing; and so of Galatians,
or any of the books of the New Testament. While a single
undoubted quotation proves the existence of that which is
quoted from, non-quotation may prove nothing at all.</p>

<p>Justin apparently has one quotation from the Fourth Gospel,
with many implied references to it. But if there were
neither the one nor the other, to infer his ignorance of that
Gospel from his silence would be just as sensible as to infer
that a lawyer had never heard of Blackstone, or Kent, or
Story, because he has not quoted from them.</p>

<p>If Justin in his Apology quoted once from Mark, and once
from John, and not at all from Acts, or Revelations, or Paul’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Epistles, it was because his subject did not call for any use of
those writings, beyond the use which he made of Mark and
John. And if (as was apparently the fact) he quoted Luke
six times and Matthew eighteen times in his Apology, it was
doubtless because Matthew better served his purpose, or was
more firmly fixed in his memory, from his having been born in
Palestine, where Matthew’s Gospel was published.</p>

<p>A like explanation accounts for the fact that the Fourth
Gospel is not quoted by Polycarp in his Epistle to the Philippians.
Neither does he quote or cite from Revelations.</p>

<p>The result so far is this: The Fourth Gospel, apparently,
is quoted by Basilides, and Justin, and Papias; and, in addition,
there are many implied references to it. There is about
the same amount of evidence in respect to Mark and the book
of Acts. The evidence accumulates as to Luke’s Gospel,
and from Matthew, the quotations and citations become very
numerous.</p>

<p>That these quotations and citations were forgeries is an
idea that cannot be seriously entertained by anybody. There
were originals from which the quotations were taken; and
presumptively, those originals were the “Memoirs” so often
referred to by Justin; and <i>presumptively</i> our Gospels were
those <i>Memoirs</i>, since they answer the description. And
unless it can be shown that <i>other</i> writings <i>that will answer
the description</i> were then extant, this presumption is well nigh
conclusive.</p>

<p>The latest work in this country which denies the genuineness
of our Gospels, is “The History of the Christian
religion to the year two hundred.” (Chicago, 1881.) The
author says it is the result of an investigation extending
through several years, two of which were spent in the library
of congress, “which is peculiarly rich in the department of
biblical literature.” He claims that his volume “will be
found to be the most complete record of the events connected
with the Christian religion during the first two centuries,
which has ever been presented to the public.” He shows no
lack of ability or disposition to make as strong a case as
possible against our Gospels. And he understands the issue.
For, he says, the question what Gospels were used by Justin,
“is of the highest importance.” In this work, then, if
anywhere, should there be proof of <i>other</i> writings than our
Gospels, that will meet the requirements of the case. But
what do we find? It gives a list of “<i>forty Gospels</i>,” before
the decree of Pope Gelasius, A.D. 494. The only marvel is
that the list is not longer. The greater portion are the now
extant Apocryphal Gospels, Acts, and Revelations, which
may be found in Vol. XVI., of the Ante-Nicene Christian
Library. Much confusion, says<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Dr. Ezra Abbot, has arisen
from the fact that the term “Gospel” was in ancient times
applied to speculative works which gave the writer’s view of
the Gospel, <i>i. e.</i>, of the doctrine of Christ, or among the
Gnostics, which set forth their <i>gnosis</i>; <i>e. g.</i>, among the
followers of Basilides, Hippolytus tells us, “The Gospel is
the knowledge of supermundane things.” Of all the Apocryphal
Gospels, Samuel Ives Curtiss, the well-known German
professor in the Chicago Theological Seminary, writes:<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I shall not waste any ink or paper to prove that the Protevangelium,
the Gospel of the Infancy, the Acts of Pilate, etc., in
their present forms as known to us and as quoted by Judge Waite,
arose at a later period than our canonical Gospels.” ... “A
knowledge of the original sources and the literature of the subject
would have saved him from this pitiful blunder. I simply refer
to Professor Lipsius’ article on the Apocryphal Gospels, in Smith
and Wace’s Dictionary of Christian Biography, London, 1880,
Vol. II., pp. 700, <i>seq.</i>; and Holtzmann’s Apocryphon des Neuen
Testaments, in Schenkel’s Bible Lexicon, Leipzig, 1869, Vol. I.,
pp. 170 <i>seq.</i> As neither of these articles are by orthodox men, or
by those who have the slightest bias toward orthodoxy, they are
calculated to inspire confidence in persons of every shade of belief
or disbelief. Both are authorities; Meyer’s Conversations-Lexikon
says of Professor Lipsius, of Jena, that he is one of the
most eminent scholars in Germany.” (See <a href="#Footnote_27">note 2</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p>With this concurring judgment of the most eminent
scholars, not much time should be spent upon these
Apocryphal books. But a single quotation is given by
Judge Waite that is claimed by him to have been made by
Justin from either of them. And this (although not to be
found in any <i>single</i> passage in our Gospels) may be gathered
from different passages, which would be in keeping with
Justin’s mode. It corresponds quite nearly, though not precisely,
with a <i>part</i><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the description in the Protevangelium of
the announcement to Mary. But this no more proves the
use of the Protevangelium by Justin than it proves the use of
Justin’s Apology by the writer of the Protevangelium. Aside
from this quotation, there are a few facts stated by Justin
that are claimed, by some persons, to have been taken from
the Apocryphal Gospels. <i>One</i> is, that Jesus made ploughs
and yokes, which Justin of course would infer, from the fact
that it was a part of the business of a carpenter to make
ploughs and yokes. <i>Another</i> is, that Jesus was born in a
cave. Dr. Thompson, says<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, “It is not impossible, to say the
least, but that the apartment in which our Saviour was born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
was in part a cave. I have seen many such, consisting of
one or more rooms in front of and including a cavern, where
the cattle were kept.” Justin, who was a native of Judea,
added a circumstance well known from tradition, which Luke
did not think it of consequence to mention, that the manger
was in a cave, <i>i. e.</i>, that the stable in which was the manger
was in a cave. He had no occasion to resort to books for
such a fact. <i>Another</i> is, that Justin refers the Roman
Emperor to “Acts of Pilate” as affording evidence of what
he had stated concerning Christ’s crucifixion, and the miracles
which he had performed. According to the usual course,
Pilate should have made a report of the crucifixion. It is
supposed that he did, and that it was lost or destroyed.
Justin appeals to it, as if then in the archives of the government.
Whether he was well or ill informed upon the subject,
the document to which he appeals, clearly was not understood
by him to be one of the “Memoirs” of Christ, “drawn up”
by an Apostle, or a “companion” of an Apostle. Nothing
purporting to be Pilate’s report is extant. The Apocryphal
book, known as the Gospel of Nicodemus or Acts of Pilate,
does not purport to contain<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> any such report. <i>Another</i> is,
that Justin says that Christ was of the House of David; a
fact which Jesus himself had declared<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and which is also
referred to, in Acts. The only remaining fact, in respect to
the alleged use of the Protevangelium, is in relation to the
<i>census</i>. It is claimed that Justin and the Protevangelium
agree that it was only to be taken in Judea.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But Justin does
not so state. It also happens, that while Justin makes mention
of Cyrenius, the Protevangelium only says, “And there
was an order from the Emperor Augustus that all in Bethlehem
of Judea should be enrolled,” saying nothing of Cyrenius.
This is followed by an absurd and worthless story of
occurrences, by the way. Justin has two references to the
census, which will be found in the note.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Justin, in stating
that there was a census in Judea, does not exclude the idea
that it was more general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Judge Waite, following the anonymous author of “The
Supernatural,” and others, also claims that Justin’s statement
that at the baptism of Jesus “a <i>fire</i> was kindled in the
Jordan,” must have been taken either from the “Gospel of
the Hebrews,” or the “Preaching of Paul.” As to the
former (as he gives the translation from a fragment from
Jerome) it is, that, “certainly there shone around the place a
great <i>light</i>,” which is not what Justin said. There is no
evidence from any quarter that this “Gospel of the Hebrews”
was in existence (other than as Matthew’s Gospel was in existence),
when Justin wrote. Nor is there any evidence that it
was in use, at <i>any</i> period, except among the Nazarenes (a
small Judaizing sect of Christians), and the Cerinthians, and
Ebionites, two heretical sects. The very authorities quoted
to prove its existence, clearly show that it was never in
<i>general</i> use, or accepted by the churches generally. Neither
the work itself, nor Jerome’s translation of it, has been in
existence <i>for centuries</i>. From what is known of it, it seems
to have been<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, “not entire
and perfect, but corrupted and curtailed.” It omitted the
first two chapters. Some of the corruptions show its true
character<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> so far as it varied from Matthew’s Hebrew Gospel;
for as Papias wrote, and the Fathers generally believed,
Matthew first composed his Gospel in the Hebrew dialect.</p>

<p>“The Preaching of Paul” was less known, and even of less
account, than the other. Judge Waite says (p. 229) that it
“was referred to by Lactantius and others, and was generally
known in the second century.” But he furnishes no evidence
of it, and Lactantius died about A.D. 325. As to its contents,
Judge Waite only says that “It contained references to the
Sybilline writings; also to the fire in Jordan at the time of
the baptism of Jesus.” There is no good reason to suppose
that it was <i>extant</i> when Justin wrote; and most certainly, it
was never received by the churches generally. Eusebius
does not seem to have known anything of it, unless to
reject it as spurious. He says (Book III., c. 25): “Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the spurious, must be numbered both the books called ‘The
Acts of Paul,’ and that called ‘Pastor,’ and ‘The Revelation
of Peter.’”</p>

<p>Eusebius also is equally pronounced against the production
called the “Gospel according to Peter.” That this “Gospel”
was referred to by Justin in the passage before considered
(<i>vide</i> c. 4), is the fact <i>to be proved</i>. The first <i>mention</i> of
it, was by Serapion<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, who became Bishop of Antioch A.D.
191, fifty years after Justin wrote. He found a few copies
of it among his flock, which he replaced, substituting Mark’s
Gospel for it, for the reason that he found in it “many things
superadded to the sound faith of our Saviour; and some also
attached, that are foreign to it.” This <i>bishop</i> seems to have
had no knowledge of its existence till that time. It favored
the Docetæ, from some of whom it had come into his parish.
The pretence that Tertullian referred to it, and intended to
assert that in his day the Gospel of Mark was understood to
have this Gospel of Peter for its original, has nothing to rest
upon but another perversion of Tertullian’s meaning. The
passage relied upon is here given with such words in italics
as must be <i>supplied</i> to warrant the use which has been
attempted to be made of it: “The Gospel which Mark published
is affirmed to be” <i>what is known as</i> “Peter’s” <i>Gospel</i>,
“whose interpreter Mark was.” This forced construction,
would make Mark the interpreter, <i>not</i> of Peter, but of the
heretical work at some time known by some as <i>Peter’s Gospel</i>.
Not Strauss himself, nor even the author of “The Supernatural,”
so interpreted Tertullian. What Tertullian wrote
was, that “The Gospel which Mark published is affirmed to
be Peter’s; whose interpreter Mark was.” Marcion mutilated
Luke’s Gospel, and Judge Waite says, “Tertullian called him <i>a
hound</i>.” If any one in his day had perverted his language as
to Mark’s Gospel, so as to make it endorse the work which
Serapion (who was a cotemporary of Tertullian) suppressed
as heretical, Tertullian would not have been likely to have
used a <i>less</i> expressive word than that which he applied to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Marcion. Tertullian simply meant, as Papias had written,
and the church believed, that Mark was Peter’s <i>interpreter</i>,
and in <i>that</i> sense Mark’s Gospel was Peter’s Gospel.</p>

<p>The next writer referred to for “Peter’s Gospel” is Origen,
A.D. 230. Origen says: “There are some who say the
brethren of Christ were the children of Joseph by a former
wife, who lived with him before Mary; and they are induced
to this opinion by some passages in that <i>which is entitled</i>
(the italics are ours) ‘The Gospel of Peter, or the Book of
James.’” When it is considered that Origen, in most explicit
terms, declares that our four Gospels “are the only undisputed
ones in the whole Church of God throughout the
world,” and that of these, “the second is according to Mark,
who composed it as Peter explained it to him, whom he also
acknowledges as his son in his General Epistle,” the perversion
of his language is apparent. Mr. Norton, whose
opinion, it is conceded, “is entitled to great weight,” upon a
careful examination of the subject, believes that this “Gospel”
was not a history or biography of Christ’s ministry at
all, but only a <i>doctrinal</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> treatise. <i>Not a single fragment
of it has come down to us.</i> There is no evidence from any
quarter that it was <i>generally</i> received in the churches <i>at any</i>
period; on the contrary, the evidence, so far as it goes, proves
that it was not so received. It was the Gospel exclusively
used by the Ebionites,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and neither Justin nor the majority
of Christians in his time were Ebionites. Its very suppression
by Serapion is conclusive; and there is nothing to
impeach Eusebius’ judgment against it. There is no evidence
that it was even in existence when Justin wrote, for
the mere fact of its being found by Serapion forty or fifty
years after is too remote. <i>Hence</i>, if Justin, in the paragraph
before quoted in chapter four, by “<i>him</i>” meant Peter, instead
of Christ (which we do not accept),<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the Gospel of
Mark, which in a sense was understood to be Peter’s, was the
one intended; and the true construction of the words in
question is of minor importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>Judge Waite has succeeded as well as any one, in his attempt
to find <i>other</i> writings than our Gospels, that will meet the
necessities of the case. Professor Lipsius, one of the most
eminent scholars in Germany, says,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> “The attempt to prove
that Justin Martyr and the Clementine Homilies had one
extra-canonical authority common to them both, either in the
Gospel to the Hebrews or in the Gospel of St. Peter, has
altogether failed.” Of recent writers this side of the ocean,
Dr. Ezra Abbot of Harvard College (who has already “a
distinguished Continental reputation”), states,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> after a thorough
examination of the whole subject, as some of the results:
“We have seen that there is no <i>direct</i> evidence of any
weight that Justin used either the ‘Gospel according to the
Hebrews’ (so far as this was distinguished from the Gospel
according to Matthew) or the ‘Gospel according to Peter.’
That he should have taken either of these as the source of
his quotations, or that either of these constituted the ‘Memoirs’
read generally at public worship in the Christian
churches of his time, is in the highest degree improbable.”...
“Still less can be said in behalf of the hypothesis that
any other Apocryphal ‘Gospel’ of which we know anything,
constituted the ‘Memoirs,’ which he cites, if they were one
book, or was included among them, if they were several.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rowe’s<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> judgment is, that the facts referred to by
Justin, but not recorded in the Gospels, stand to those which
<i>are</i> recorded, in the proportion of only four, to one hundred
and ninety-six. In other words, that all but four out of
about two hundred references, appear in the Gospels. “It is
marvellous,” he says, “when we consider the nearness of the
time when Justin lived to our Lord’s ministry, that he should
have preserved so few incidents respecting it which vary
from those in our Gospels, rather than that those to which he
has referred should present the slight variations they do; for
it is an interval within which traditionary reminiscences
must have possessed all their freshness.”</p>

Holy Ghost and shalt bear a son, and he shall be called the Son of the
Highest, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people
from their sins.’” After a dozen lines, the last clause is repeated as follows:
“Wherefore, too, the angel said to the virgin, ‘Thou shalt call his
name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.’” The last clause
seems to have been transferred from Matthew by Justin. The Protevangelium
(c. 11) reads as follows: “And she hearing, reasoned with herself,
saying: Shall I conceive by the Lord, the living God? And shall I
bring forth, as every woman brings forth? And the angel of the Lord
said: Not so, Mary; for the power of the Lord shall overshadow thee;
wherefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called

shall save his people from their sins. And Mary said: Behold the servant
of the Lord before his face; let it be unto me according to thy word. And
she made the purple and the scarlet and took them to the priest,” etc.
The account is preceded by the story that it had fallen to her lot to spin
purple and scarlet for the veil of the temple, and that when the angel
spake to her she was going with a pitcher to fill it with water. It is not
easy to believe that Justin’s simple narrative came from such a source.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[14]</a> The entire passage is as follows: “And when it is said that he
changed the name of one of the Apostles to Peter; and when it is written
in the Memoirs of him that this so happened, as well as that he changed
the names of other two brothers, the sons of Zebedee, to Boanerges, which
means sons of thunder; this was an announcement of the fact that it was he
by whom Jacob was called Israel, and Oshea called Jesus (Joshua) under
whose name the people who survived of those who came from Egypt were
conducted into the land promised to the patriarchs.” The controversy is,
whether the personal pronouns “He” and “Him” refer to Jesus, or whether
“Him” refers to Peter. Judge Waite says that Justin has ten times
“Memoirs of the Apostles,” and five times, “Memoirs,” and not once,
“Memoirs of Christ.” It is true we do not find “Memoirs of Christ.”
But confessedly the Memoirs intended were of or concerning Christ, and
not of or concerning the Apostles, or either of them. Justin used the
expression Memoirs of the Apostles just as we say the Gospel of John.
They were concerning Christ; he is the grand subject of discourse in all
Justin’s writings. And in Ap. c. 33, Justin speaks of those “who have
written Memoirs of all things concerning our Saviour Jesus Christ.” In
the proper and highest sense they should only be spoken of as “Memoirs
of Christ.”</p>

<p>Judge Waite, after the author of “The Supernatural” (p. 337), says, to
refer to the more distant antecedent is contrary to the rule. The rule is of
but slight importance as compared to the whole scope. And to apply the
rule here, Peter would be the one who changed the names of the sons of
Zebedee; for Peter, and not Christ, would be the last antecedent.</p>

<span class="smaller">PRESUMPTION OF PERMANENCY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In general, says Mr. Phillips,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> there is a presumption in favor
of the continuance of what is once proved to have existed.
It is a familiar principle of law, says Chief Justice Parker,
that a state of things once shown to exist is presumed to continue
until something is shown to rebut the presumption.
And this position, says Professor Greenleaf, is founded “on
the experienced <i>continuance</i> or permanency of longer or
shorter duration in human affairs. When, therefore, the existence
of a person, a personal relation, or a state of things,
is once established by proof, the law presumes that the person,
relation, or state of things continues to exist as before,
until the contrary is shown, or until a different presumption
is raised from the nature of the subject in question.” With
other examples of the application of this presumption, he
mentions opinions and religious convictions: “The <i>opinions</i>
also of individuals, once entertained and expressed, and the
<i>state</i> of <i>mind</i>, once proved to exist, are presumed to remain
unchanged until the contrary appears. Thus, all the members
of a Christian community, being presumed to entertain
the common faith, no man is supposed to disbelieve the existence
and moral government of God, until it is shown from
his own declarations.” This presumption being founded in
reason and experience, is of universal application. It is not
conclusive, but stands “until something is shown to rebut it.”
It is the basis of Hume’s argument against miracles, but
which he misapplies, making it conclusive instead of presumptive
evidence. As a presumption, it is strictly applicable
to the question in hand, and will be found to have great force.
For, from this natural and reasonable presumption, it should
be taken, unless the contrary is proved, that the accepted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
“Memoirs” of Justin’s time <i>remained</i> in the churches. Hence
if we can ascertain with entire certainty <i>what</i> “Memoirs”
were accepted in the churches in the year 180, and no evidence
of displacement and substitution appears, we shall have
<i>most satisfactory evidence</i> what “Memoirs” were the ones intended
by him in his Apology.</p>

<p>There is undoubted proof that within forty years from the
time Justin wrote his First Apology, our Four Gospels (and
no others) with the Book of Acts, were universally received in
the church, as we now receive them. It comes from the writings
of Agrippa Castor, Apollinaris, Bishop of Hierapolis,
Apelles, Athenagoras, Basilides, Celsus, Clement of Alexandria,
Eusebius, Heracleon, Irenæus, Jerome, Marcion, Melito, Bishop
of Sardis, Origen, Pantænus, Polycarp, Serapion, Tatian, Theophilus,
Tertullian, Valentine, The Letter of the Church of Vienne
and Lyons, and the unknown authors of the Clementine
Homilies, and the Muratori Canon—Christians, Gnostics,
Heretics, and Heathen, all concurring to prove universal reception,
beyond a reasonable doubt. So strong is this proof that
even Strauss does not deny such reception by the <i>end</i> of the
second century, and he admits that there is evidence of
an <i>earlier</i> date. He says: “We learn from the works of
Irenæus, of Clement Alexandrinus, and of Tertullian, that,
at the end of the second century after Christ, our Four
Gospels were recognized by the orthodox church as the
writings of the Apostles and the disciples [companions]
of the Apostles, and were separated from many other similar
productions, as authentic records of the life of Jesus. The
first Gospel, according to our Canon, is attributed [i. e.
by the authors named] to Matthew, who is enumerated
among the twelve Apostles; the fourth to John, the beloved
disciple of our Lord; the second to Mark, the interpreter of
Peter;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the third to Luke, the companion of Paul. We
have, besides, the authority of earlier authors, both in their
own works, and in quotations cited by others.” As a false
witness sometimes admits a part, the better to conceal what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
is more important, so Strauss <i>admits</i> a state of things as existing
at the <i>end</i> of the century, that, beyond dispute, should
be carried back to a time at least twenty years earlier. Thus
Professor Fisher, in his exhaustive work, says of John’s Gospel
(which is conceded to have been the last): “We choose
to begin<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with the unquestioned fact of the universal reception
of the Fourth Gospel as genuine in the last quarter of
the second century. At that time we find that it was held in
every part of Christendom to be the work of the Apostle
John. The prominent witnesses are Tertullian in North
Africa, Clement in Alexandria, and Irenæus in Gaul.” And
Professor Abbot<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> says: “I begin with the statement, which
cannot be questioned, that our present Gospels, and no
others, were received by the great body of Christians as
genuine and sacred books during the last quarter of the
second century.”</p>

<p>Theophilus of Antioch, <i>as early</i> as A.D. 180, not only quotes
from the Fourth Gospel, as Scripture, but names John as its
author, as follows:<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “As the Holy Scriptures, and all who
have the Spirit, teach us, among whom John says, ‘In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;’ signifying
that God alone was in the beginning, and that the
Word was in him. And then he says, the Word was God,
and all things were made by Him, and without him there was
not anything made.” Theophilus also wrote a Commentary
upon the Gospels. Before this time, also, our Gospels and
Acts had been included in a list<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of canonical books
received in the churches. They were in their present
order, and, as far as their authorship is stated, are attributed
to the persons whose names are now assigned to
them. And before<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> this date, Celsus (who anticipated Strauss
by seventeen hundred years) had cited alleged contradictions
in the Gospels, and particularly as to there being one or two
angels at the sepulchre. He attempted to ridicule the idea
that blood and water came from Jesus’ side—a fact that is
stated only in John. He refers to the fact that Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
“after his death arose, and showed the marks of his
punishment, and how his hands had been pierced.” Although
he does not <i>name</i> the authors of the books, yet
his numerous quotations correspond with them, including
Luke and John. And in respect to all of the discrepancies,
etc., he says: “All these things I have taken
out of your own books,” i. e. Scriptures. “We need,” says
he, “no after witness, for you fall upon your own swords.”
His work has not come down to us except as contained in
Origen’s writings, which, however, quote so fully from it, that
it is nearly reproduced. And ten years<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> before this time,
Tatian, who had been a disciple of Justin (but after Justin’s
death became heretical), wrote a Commentary or Harmony
upon the Gospels. He called it Diatesseron, which means
the Gospel of the Four. The celebrated Syrian, Father
Ephræm, who died A.D. 373, wrote a commentary on it. Bar-Salibi,
who flourished in the last part of the twelfth century,
was also well acquainted with Tatian’s work; and says that it
began with John i. 1: “<i>In the beginning was the Word</i>.”</p>

<p>Before this date, Heracleon, a disciple of the Gnostic Valentine,
wrote a commentary upon the Fourth Gospel. The work
is known<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to us through many fragments, which Origen has
woven into his own commentary on the same Gospel.</p>

<p>Quotations from the canonical Gospels <i>between</i> the periods
mentioned are very numerous. It is unnecessary to cite
them, or to give other specific proof of a state of things existing
<i>as early</i> as 180, as shown by most incontrovertible evidence,
whatever doubt may be had as to some items of this evidence.
Indeed an earlier date might properly be assumed than that
taken as the basis of our argument. Thus Dr. Charteris, in
his recent work, says, in view of all the circumstances: “When
we pass the <i>middle</i> of the century, and come to the works of
Tatian, Athenagoras, and Theophilus (with a quotation by
name) we are out of the region of controversy.” (Canonicity,
lxxxi.) There were a few persons called the Alogi, a nickname
having the double meaning of “deniers of the doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Logos,” and “men without reason,” who denied John’s
authorship of the Fourth Gospel. They were probably a few<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
eccentric individuals, who attracted no attention, and none of
whose names are preserved. The fact that they appealed to
no tradition in favor of their views, denied John’s authorship
of the Apocalypse likewise, and absurdly ascribed both to
Cerinthus, whom no one supposes could have been their
author, shows that they were persons of no critical judgment.
They were <i>outside</i> of the churches of which Justin wrote. The
reception of the canonical Gospels, to the exclusion of all
others, was <i>universal</i> in those churches.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[5]</a> A fragment of this writing was discovered by the Italian scholar Muratori,
and from him is called the Muratori Canon. It is written in Latin,
but is supposed to have been first written in Greek. The first part of the
writing is wanting, so that it begins with Luke, which it calls the “Third
book of the Gospel according to Luke.” It was found in the Ambrosian
Library, at Milan, in a manuscript containing extracts from writings of
Ambrose, Chrysostom, and others. It professes to give a list of the writings
that are recognized in the Christian Church. Judge Waite (p. 412)
assigns A.D. 190 as its date. Prof. Curtiss says of it: “<i>The most eminent
New Testament scholars</i> in America, England and Germany, with a few
exceptions, hold that it was written in the last quarter of the second century
(the most setting the date at about 170-180 A.D.) Some of them are:
Prof. Ezra Abbot, of Harvard College; Drs. E. A. Abbott, Canon Wescott,
W. A. Sanday, Credner, Weiseler, Bleek, Reuss, Hilgenfeld, and many
others” (<i>Inter-Ocean</i>, February 12, 1881). The Fragment contains internal
evidence of the time when it was written. In reference to the “Pastor”
it says: This “did Hermas write, <i>very recently, in our times</i>, in the city of
Rome, while his brother Bishop Pius sat in the chair in the church of

<p>Now consider the tremendous force of the proved fact that,
within forty years of the time when Justin wrote his First
Apology, we reach a period when it is no longer a debatable
question whether our Gospels are “the Memoirs” of Christ
which were read with the Prophets in city and country. The
presumption of <i>continuance</i> attaches. It has before been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the year one hundred
and forty, there were accepted “Memoirs” of our Lord,
which were read with the Prophets in all the churches. There
is no evidence whatever that those Memoirs in the intervening
forty years were dropped and others substituted for them;
therefore it should be presumed that they were in the churches
in the year one hundred and eighty; and the Memoirs in the
churches at this latter period <i>are positively known and seen, to
have been the Canonical Gospels</i>. They have come closer to
us, and in the nearer vision we are able to determine their
identity with the utmost certainty. And the natural presumption
that there was no substitution within the short
interval of forty years, is immensely strengthened by the
difficulties attending any attempted substitution,—difficulties
so great that they must have left unmistakable evidence of
conflict upon the page of history. The churches were very
numerous, and occupied a territory of more than two thousand
miles in extent from Syria to Gaul. Each church had its
bishop or presbyter, and elders; and in each church, once in
seven days, were the Memoirs of our Lord read with the
Prophets. There were hundreds who, from their own recollections,
and thousands who, from their parents or instructors,
at any given time within these forty years, had perfect knowledge
what Memoirs were thus read in the year one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and forty. Young men of twenty then, were only sixty, forty
years later. Was there a substitution in those forty years,
and these bishops, and elders, and thousands of communicants
every Sabbath of all ages, not know it; or knowing it had not
objected; or objecting, and history have no record of it? Not
a few of these were educated men; and indeed all the bishops
and elders may be presumed to have been as well versed in the
accepted Gospels as in the writings of the prophets. It is to
be borne in mind that we are dealing now with the question
of substitution within the short period of forty years. A
<i>score</i> of names can be given of men living within that time or
immediately after, who, from their own recollection or from
others, must have had perfect knowledge of the whole subject:
Athenagoras, a philosopher at Athens about the year one
hundred and sixty; Caius, a presbyter at Rome about the
year two hundred; Claudius Apollinaris, Bishop of Hierapolis,
<i>cir.</i> 173; Clement of Alexandria, who became the head of the
Alexandrian School in 187; Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, who
died a martyr in 173; Hegesippus, the historian (whose
works are now lost), who died in 180; Hermas, who was
prominent toward the close of the century; Irenæus, Bishop
of Lyons; Justin himself, whose martyrdom was as late as the
year 165; Leonides, the martyr; Melito, Bishop of Sardis;
the world-renowned Origen, son of Leonides; Pantænus;
Polycarp; Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus; Pothinus the predecessor
of Irenæus (and whose martyrdom was about 167);
Serapion, Bishop of Antioch; Tertullian, the eloquent Roman
lawyer of Carthage; Theophilus, the predecessor of Serapion;
and Victor, Bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>It may be said, and with truth, that the Fourth Gospel,
whenever introduced, came in not as a substitute, but as a
supplement. The evidence, however, is conclusive that by the
year one hundred and eighty, it had obtained as permanent a
footing as either of the other Gospels. Its reception was as
hearty, and the tradition of its authorship as strong, as in
respect to the others. To infer that it was the forged product<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of the period now under consideration, or any other, is as if De
Soto had concluded that the mighty stream which he discovered
hastening to the Gulf, with deep and rapid current,
so wide that a man could scarcely be seen from shore to shore,
had its origin not in far-off lakes or mountains, but in some
miserable crocodile swamp of the country he was traversing,
and but just out of sight. And <i>who</i> forged the Fourth Gospel
and imposed it as John’s upon this score of persons, and
hundreds of others? Or did these men conspire together, to
deceive themselves, the churches, and the world? What
name has come down to us from <i>that</i> age, or any other, who
was <i>capable</i> of such an undertaking? What <i>forger</i> wrote
those discourses of Our Lord with Nicodemus? Or those
with the women of Samaria? Or those with his disciples on
the eve of his crucifixion? Or the parable of the good Shepherd?
Or that memorable prayer recorded in the seventeenth
of John? That any <i>sane man</i> should attribute either of these
to a <i>criminal forger</i> would be incredible, if we were not confronted
with the fact. And what sort of a man was this forger
of the Fourth Gospel? We have Baur’s conception of him as
“A man of remarkable mind, of an elevated spirit, and penetrated
with a warm adoring faith in Christ as the Son of God
and Saviour of the world!” And Baur thinks it <i>easier</i> to
believe (without proof) in the existence of this remarkable
genius and elevated character, who would <i>invent</i> fictitious discourses,
<i>falsely</i> attribute them to the Christ whom he <i>adored</i>,
and <i>forge</i> the name of the beloved disciple, than to believe
with the whole body of the Christian Church, that the discourses
and utterances were those of our Lord!<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If John did
not write the Fourth Gospel, <i>who did</i>? Not one of those
who deny his authorship, can give an answer to this question.
It is no answer to say that many in the second century believed
that Hermas (whom Paul mentions in his Epistle to the
Romans), wrote the Pastor or Shepherd of Hermas. Such
was not the universal sentiment. The work was never generally
received as Scripture. On the contrary, the author of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the Muratorian Fragment, while placing the Four Gospels in
the list of canonical books universally received, says of “The
Pastor,” that it was written “very recently in our times” by
another Hermas, a brother of the Bishop of Rome, and that it
was read in “some of the churches,” not as Scripture but for
“edification,” the same as the Epistle of Clement. It was
rejected by Tertullian, not only as Apocryphal, but as hurtful.
Nor is it any answer, to say that the so-called Epistle of
Barnabas was early attributed to Barnabas the Levite. In
the first place, it is by no means certain that this tradition
was unfounded. From the little we know of Barnabas,
it would be rash to conclude that he could not have written it.
If uninspired, he <i>may</i> have written just such a book. In the
second place, no one ascribed it to him till the time of Clement
of Alexandria, and it was ranked by Eusebius among the
“spurious” writings, which, however much known and read
in the church, were never regarded as authoritative. Eusebius
also places The Pastor Hermas in the list of writings whose
authorship is disputed. The Fourth Gospel rests upon an
entirely different basis. There was but <i>one</i> tradition in
respect to it, and from our first knowledge of it, it was regarded
as authoritative, and its authorship was undisputed; for the
slight exception of the few individuals, called the Alogi, is of
no account. It was included in the commentaries and harmonies
to which reference has been made; and such works
would not have been written until the books upon which they
were based had been long enough in the churches for a felt
need of commentaries upon them. It was quoted as Scripture
by Theophilus, and John its author was expressly named as
moved by the Holy Ghost. In the Muratori Canon, it was
placed as Scripture in the list of Canonical books, universally
received. And that it could not have come in after the year
one hundred and forty, or have been received unless it was
genuine, will be still more obvious from a more particular
consideration of some of those who accepted it. Pantænus,
who was at the head of the Alexandrian school in the year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
one hundred and eighty, was (says Eusebius) distinguished
for his learning. Before his conversion he was a Stoic philosopher.
After that, and before he became the head of the
Catechetical school, he traveled extensively as an Evangelist.
He went as far as the Indies, where he found that the Apostle
Bartholomew, who had preceded him, had left the Gospel of
Matthew in Hebrew. Pantænus could not have been ignorant
of the “Memoirs,” which were accepted in Justin’s time, and
he lived until the year two hundred and twelve. We have no
<i>direct evidence</i> from <i>him</i>; but Clement, his pupil and successor,
and noted for his learning, could not have been ignorant
of the opinions of Pantænus; and from Clement there is the
strongest testimony. He flourished between A.D. 165 and
220, and became head of the Alexandrian School in A.D. 187.
Origen, his successor, with his great genius and acquirements,
and extensive travel, and from his father Leonides, and his
predecessors Clement and Pantænus, must have been fully
informed of the “Memoirs” which were in the churches in
the year one hundred and forty. And he says, that he has
“understood <i>from tradition</i>, respecting the Four Gospels,
<i>which are the only undisputed ones in the whole church of God
throughout the world</i>,” that the first was by Matthew, the
second by Mark, “who composed it as Peter explained to
him,” the third by Luke, the companion of Paul, and “last of
all” John “who reclined upon the breast of Jesus,” has left
one Gospel, in which he confesses that he could write so
many that the whole world could not contain them. Tertullian,
the celebrated lawyer, says, “Of the Apostles, John
and Matthew published the faith to us.” In defending the
Gospel of Luke against the mutilation of the heretic Marcion,
he positively affirms that all the churches founded by the
Apostles accepted, not Marcion’s abridgment of Luke, but a
well-known form which had been “<i>received from its first
publication</i>;” and that the other Gospels had been received
from the same sources in authenticated copies. “In his
abundant writings,” says Norton,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “there is not a chapter in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John, from which he does
not quote,” and from most of them his quotations are numerous.
Tertullian was born at Carthage about A.D. 160, and
from his conversion, about the year one hundred and eighty-five,
he entered with great earnestness and ability into a
vindication of Christianity, and the discussion of various questions
connected with it. This able advocate could not have
been misinformed of the usages of the churches less than half
a century previous to the time when he entered upon his work.</p>

<p>The evidence of Irenæus is still more conclusive. He was
born in Syria about A.D. 120, and he was therefore twenty
years old when Justin wrote. His teacher was Polycarp,
Bishop of Smyrna, and his immediate predecessor at Lyons
was Pothinus. Polycarp, at his martyrdom, was asked to
save his life by denying Christ. “No,” he said, “eighty and
six years have I served him and he never did me any injury;
how, then, can I blaspheme my King and my Saviour?”
<i>Pothinus</i>, at <i>his</i> martyrdom, <i>cir.</i> 177, was more than ninety
years old. The lives of these two men reached far back into
the first century. They were at, or past, middle life when
Justin wrote, and presbyters of important churches; and it is
utterly incredible that they should not have known what
“Memoirs” were read in their churches in Justin’s time.
And it is <i>equally incredible</i> that Irenæus, the disciple of the one
and the immediate successor in office of the other, and <i>himself</i>
<i>twenty years old</i> when Justin wrote, should not have been as
well informed upon this subject. Yet Irenæus quotes<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> from
our Gospels and Acts, as Scripture, ascribes their authorship
to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and says that such was
the accepted tradition in all the churches. After referring to
the others, he says of the Fourth Gospel: “Afterwards John,
the disciple of our Lord, the same that lay upon his bosom,
also published the Gospel while he was yet at Ephesus, in
Asia” (Eu. v. 8). And again<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>: “All the Elders testify, who
were conversant with John, the disciple of our Lord, in Asia,
that he delivered these things.” About A.D. 180, in a treatise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
against heretics, he appeals to the canonical Gospels with as
much confidence that they are all well known and accepted by
Christians, as any would do at the present day. Tischendorf<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
says the number of passages where Irenæus has recourse to
the Gospels is about four hundred, and about eighty of these
in John. Sanday<a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> estimates the quotations from John in this
treatise at seventy-three. But Clement, and Origen, and
Pantænus, and Polycarp, and Pothinus, and Tertullian, were
not better informed upon this subject than Serapion, who so
promptly suppressed the heretical Gospel of Peter, or than
Theophilus, his immediate successor, who was the first after
Papias (other than the author of the Muratorian Fragment) to
mention any of the four Gospels by name, or than the author of
this Fragment, or than many intelligent officers and members
of the numerous churches from the Euphrates to the Seine.</p>

<p>With such evidence and from such sources, and the entire
absence of any evidence of <i>substitution</i>, it may well be regarded
as morally certain, that none occurred. What was
probable, from the <i>seeming</i> use of the Canonical Gospels by
Justin and his contemporaries, has become <i>a moral certainty</i>.
The Memoirs which, in the year one hundred and eighty, were
universally accepted, <i>were the same</i> that forty years before
were read with the Prophets, in city and country, in all the
churches every Sabbath day. Of this there can be no doubt.
The Memoirs of the year one hundred and eighty, <i>were</i> <span class="smcap">our
Canonical Gospels</span>; and the Memoirs of the year one hundred
and forty, <i>were</i> <span class="smcap">our Canonical Gospels</span>. And we take
our stand with Justin, with these Gospels in our hands,
only forty years from the death of John, the beloved disciple,
and at the close of a hundred years from the crucifixion of our
Lord. And still we ascend the stream.</p>

<p>The evidence thus far has proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that at the writing of Justin’s First Apology, the Canonical
Gospels were read with the Prophets in city and country,
on “the day called Sunday,” as authentic Memoirs of our
Lord. Assuming the date<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of this Apology to have been
A.D. 138 or 139, the time was a little over one hundred years
from the Crucifixion, and less than eighty years from the
death of Mark and Luke, and all the Apostles other than
John, and only forty years from his death. How long were
these periods as they affect the argument from the universal
reception of the Gospels in Justin’s time, and from the universal
tradition in their favor which accompanied such reception?
The writer has within two days (in April, 1881) met
with three persons who saw Lafayette on his visit to New
England in 1824. One of them distinctly remembers the
sentiment<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which Lafayette gave at Concord, and another
shook hands with him. There were hundreds of Revolutionary
soldiers present, some of whom the General recognized
and called by name, although he had not seen their faces for
more than forty years. This was in 1824. Whittier’s poem
describes one of these soldiers, as he now remembers him, at
the time of Monroe’s tour in 1817, <i>sixty-four years ago</i>:</p>

Timothy Walker was the first pastor, November, 1880, celebrated
its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary. There are
several towns in New Hampshire, as Londonderry, Dover,
Exeter and Portsmouth, that were settled earlier than Concord;
and some of them as early as 1623. The landing of
the Pilgrims was <i>two hundred and sixty years ago</i>. It seems
but as yesterday. A century from the Crucifixion was no
longer than a century now; and as an event, to be remembered,
the Crucifixion was as much greater than the Landing
of the Pilgrims as the glory of the noonday sun is above that
of the feeblest star in the most distant heavens. The time
that has elapsed since Timothy Walker wrote Diaries which
are now in existence is as long as from the Crucifixion to
Justin’s Apology; more than thirty years longer than from
the martyrdom of Peter and Paul to Justin’s Apology; and
sixty years longer than from John’s death to Justin’s Apology.
The churches in Justin’s time were not dealing with
writings from a dim and misty past, or of limited or infrequent
use. None were as ancient as Walker’s Diary; the
last had not seen half its years; they were in all the churches,
and read every Sabbath day. The argument which proves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
that there was no substitution between 140 and 180 is as
much more forcible to prove that there was no substitution
between the years 100 and 140, or between the years 60 and
100, as those times were nearer the great events which the
Gospels recorded. If, for example, there were accepted
Memoirs of our Lord in the churches in the year 100, from
the presumed <i>continuance</i> of a state of things the existence of
which has been proved,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> it should be <i>presumed</i> that they
remained in the churches till Justin’s time, there being no
evidence to the contrary. And so there would be the same
(or greater) difficulties in the way of displacement and substitution,
between the year 100 and the year 140, as between
the year 140 and the year 180. Justin and his contemporaries
had from their own recollection,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or from others, whether parents,
teachers, presbyters or bishops, as great facilities for
knowing what Memoirs were accepted in the churches
forty years before, as had Irenæus and his contemporaries in
respect to the period of forty years before one hundred
and eighty. And there was a succession and continued life in
the churches from 100 to 140, the same as from 140 to 180.
This reasoning is applicable to Clement and his contemporaries,
and shows that Memoirs which were in the churches
in the year 100 could not have displaced accepted and
generally received Memoirs of any previous period. We
know from the Epistle of Clement, as clearly as from Justin’s
Apology, how Christians loved and adored their Divine Lord
and Master, and how strongly attached they must have been
to any Memoirs of him, which they accepted as authentic.
And the testimony of Pliny is, that Christians in his day
were accustomed to meet before daybreak and sing a responsive
hymn to Christ as God. It is utterly incredible that
accepted Memoirs of Christ, thus worshipped, should have
been thrown aside by presbyters or bishops, and hundreds of
churches, throughout the Roman Empire, without a shock
that would have left unmistakable evidences of it in history.
There being an entire absence of any evidence of displacement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and substitution, it is <i>morally certain there was none</i>.
John’s Gospel, however, stands upon a different footing, since
it came in not to displace, but to supplement. John lived to
the close of the first century. <i>Who dared</i> to forge a spurious
Gospel in his name, so soon after his death that it had
obtained such a footing in the churches, at the end of forty
years, as to be quoted as his production? <i>Who</i>, during that
period, was <i>capable</i> of composing it? And how were hundreds
of presbyters or bishops, and churches, from Syria to
Gaul, persuaded to receive a spurious Gospel, as the genuine
work of the beloved disciple who was in life within the personal<a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
recollections of many? It is a fact to be emphasized,
that neither this Gospel, nor the others, can be assailed on
historical or traditional grounds. <i>There is but one history or
tradition</i> concerning them. The objections to them are either
negative or speculative, mere assumptions, not supported by
any history or tradition.</p>

<p>The first <i>use</i> of the four Gospels of which there is any history,
is in statements of facts found to be recorded in them,
and in quotations of teachings of Christ, corresponding with
them. The first <i>description</i> of them after Papias, is that of
“Memoirs” of Christ, “drawn up” by Apostles and companions
of Apostles. The first mention of them <i>by the names
of the writers</i>, ascribes their authorship to the men whose
names they now bear. There is no history or tradition of a
time when the first Gospel was ascribed to any but Matthew,
or the second to any but Mark, or the fourth to any but
John<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, or the third, with Acts, to any but Luke. The standing
objection that none of them is mentioned <i>by name</i> till the
time of Theophilus, and Irenæus, and the writer of the Muratori
Canon, is not of the slightest consequence as opposing
evidence. For, if these Gospels were not mentioned by name,
neither were any<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> others; and surely we are not expected to
believe that there were <i>no originals</i>, from which the many
quotations, from Clement of Rome, in the year 97, down, were
taken. This objection proves too much. For it proves, if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
proves anything, that there were <i>no</i> Gospels or writings to
answer to the quotations, which, under the circumstances, is
a palpable absurdity. Besides, it is not true in respect to the
First and Second Gospels, for Papias, certainly as early as the
middle of the second century, and probably before the year
140, gave the <i>names</i> of Matthew and Mark respectively, as
their authors, the latter being “the interpreter of Peter.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[1]</a> Judge Waite controverts the generally received opinion of the date of
Justin’s First Apology. Verissimus became Cæsar in 139, but he is not
addressed as Cæsar, but as “philosopher.” In reply to this, Mr. Waite
says, that the same is true of the Second Apology, “which is admitted by
all to have been written after 139.” In the first place, there is considerable
uncertainty which of the Apologies was first written, and some critics
maintain that what is called the Second was a preface to the First, and
others still that it was a continuation of the First. (See introductory notice
to Vol. II. of the A. N. C. L.) In the second place, the address to Urbicus
in the so-called Second Apology, was not by <i>Justin</i>. He only gives it
as the language of <i>one Lucius</i>, in narrating an occurrence which, for aught
that appears, may have taken place before the year 139. Mr. Waite also
says that Justin would be but twenty-five years of age in 139. He might
have written his Apology in 139, nevertheless. And there are many who
put his birth earlier than the year 114, and some as early as the year 85.
There are no certain data by which to determine the time of his birth.
Again he says that Marcion did not come to Rome till about 140, and that
Justin (c. 26) refers to him as being “even at this day alive, and teaching
his disciples to believe in some God greater than the Creator.” But Justin
meant to express his abhorrence of his doctrines. He refers to him as “a
man of Pontus,” and again (in c. 58) as “Marcion of Pontus,” and says the
devils put him forward. He nowhere describes him as being <i>of</i> Rome or <i>at</i>
Rome. In his extensive travels he doubtless knew of him while he was at
Pontus. Judge Waite also says that, if in the year 139, Justin would have
said that Christ was born 140 years ago, instead of 150. But correcting the
error for the beginning of our Era, the time would have been A.D. 146, or
144, as we allow four or six years for the error, and Justin, using round
numbers, would more naturally have taken the longer period. There is
nothing therefore in Judge Waite’s arguments to change the opinion in
what he concedes to be “the very valuable Encyclopedia of McClintock and
Strong,” and of Page, Neander, Lemisch, Roberts and Donaldson, Sears,
Fisher, Eusebius, (c. 8) and many others, assigning the year 139. See also
Canonicity, by Dr. Charteris (1880) p. lv. It is, however, not essential to
the argument from the First Apology, whether it was written in the year
139, or 144, or 146, or even 150 of our Era. By as much as it lengthens
the period from the death of John to the date of the First Apology, it
shortens the time between that date and the year 180.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THEIR PROPER REPOSITORIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Certain propositions have been established by facts and arguments
that cannot be successfully controverted:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The advent of Christ and its stupendous results.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The formation of numerous churches which by the end
of the first century were in all parts of the Roman Empire,
with presbyters or bishops and elders in every church, and
many thousands of communicants.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) They regarded him with the greatest reverence and
affection, obeying his commands as their Lord and Master,
paying him divine honors, and for his sake joyfully yielding up
their lives.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Of his disciples and followers, twelve, called Apostles,
were understood to have special authority from him in the
Church.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) From the nature of the case we should look for the reception
in these numerous churches, of Memoirs of their Lord
which they would <i>deem</i> authentic, and at so early a period,
that they would be able to <i>determine</i> whether they were
authentic or not.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) To such Memoirs, once accepted, they would be so
strongly attached that they could not be displaced and others
substituted for them, in hundreds of churches in all the Roman
Empire, without such controversy as would have left indubitable
evidence of it.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) As far back as history goes, doctrines<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were taught, facts
asserted, and quotations made, corresponding with the Canonical
Gospels, and such use was continued until a time when
there is a positive identification of them by name. Within
this period there was one writer making numerous quotations
and references, who declared that the writings from which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
quoted, and to which he referred, were “Memoirs” of Christ
“drawn up” by Apostles or companions of Apostles.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) There is no proof of the existence of writings <i>other</i>
than those Gospels answering to his description, or corresponding
with the quotations; and finally within forty years of
his first reference to these “Memoirs” they are clearly seen
to be the Canonical Gospels.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) From first to last there is no evidence whatever of displacement
of Gospels previously accepted, and the substitution
of others for them in the churches generally.</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>) The Fourth Gospel is of such a character, and was in
use so soon after the death of its author (and who is also stated
as its author in the Gospels itself), as to make the idea of
attempted and successful <i>forgery</i> in the highest degree
improbable.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) And these Gospels within less than eighty years
from the death of the Apostles other than John, and within
forty years of <i>his</i> death, were read with the Prophets in the
churches, in city and country, every Lord’s day, <i>and accepted
as Apostolic</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>) From the earliest period they were where they should
be if authentic, and where they could not have been, unless
<i>accepted</i> as authentic.</p>

<p>Some illustrations have already been given in chapter eleven
of the brief interval between the Apostles and Justin Martyr.
Let any intelligent reader of sixty, from his own recollection,
or any young person, from the recollections of others with
whom he is acquainted, determine for himself. The writer
was admitted to the Bar almost forty years ago; he has within
a few months seen an original deed<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of land in Londonderry
(the home of his ancestors) executed one hundred and fifty
years ago; he has in his possession certified copies of certificates
of marriages and births, in his own genealogical record—going
back from one to two hundred years, in one instance
two hundred and thirty years, and these certificates would be
received as <i>evidence</i> in any Court. They would be received,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
because made by the proper custodian of public documents,
found in the proper repository for them. The presumption of
law in such case is the judgment of charity. It presumes that
documents found in their proper repository, and not bearing
marks of forgery, are genuine. A deed forty years old, followed
by a possession agreeing with it, is admitted in evidence
without other proof of its execution. Our Gospels in Justin’s
time were where they <i>should</i> have been, if authentic. The
Church was the proper repository for authentic Memoirs of
its Founder. <i>Our Gospels were there.</i> They were in their
proper repository. And upon every principle that rules in the
administration of justice, or in the common affairs of life, it
must be presumed that they were <i>rightfully</i> there. Their rejection
is <i>not</i> “the judgment of charity.” It reverses the
maxim that fraud is not to be presumed. It charges forgery,
of which there is no evidence, upon persons whom it finds it
impossible to discover and identify. It imputes ignorance and
indifference to multitudes who had every opportunity for knowing
the truth, and who were willing to suffer all things for
their convictions of the truth. It presses, as of vital consequence,
trivial objections and alleged errors in chronology,
geography and history, which (if made out) would not for a
moment be thought sufficient to successfully impugn the authenticity
of any secular work as well supported by external
evidence. It is unnecessary to further consider such objections.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
It is no exaggeration to say, that the various
theories and speculations of those who deny the genuineness of
the Gospels are, in the main, but ingenious attempts at the
solution of the problem: “Given, the impossibility of miracles,
what may be supposed to be the true history of Jesus Christ?”
The only consistent answer that could be made, would be that
upon such an hypothesis, it is impossible to determine what
was his life or character. But, given, the possibility of miracles
(and if there is a God they must be possible), there is no
reasonable doubt of the authenticity of the Gospels, and the
book of Acts. They come to us from their proper repositories,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and must be presumed to be rightfully there. They are
proved to have been in those repositories within but a short
period from the death of the Apostles. They were accepted
as Apostolic, and as having been drawn up by Apostles or
companions of Apostles. If such undoubted reception, and
use, and tradition, at so early a period, and thence until now,
cannot be <i>trusted</i>, no credit can be given to <i>any</i> writings or
history from ancient times. They <i>can</i> be trusted. The
stream which eighteen hundred years ago was issuing from
Apostolic times and the hills of Palestine, has flowed onward,
enriching and blessing the nations.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[1]</a> Mr. Waite assumes that Clement did not hold to a literal resurrection.
Clement’s language admits of no such construction, although in writing to
Christians who understood all about it, he was not as definite upon this
point, as Justin in <i>his</i> address to a different class. Clement refers to the
resurrection in c. 24: “Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually
proves to us that there shall be a future resurrection, of which he has
rendered the Lord Jesus Christ the first fruits by raising him from the
dead.” And again in c. 42, after saying that the Apostles were commissioned,
he adds: “Having therefore, received their order, and being fully
assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and established in the
Word of God, with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming
that the kingdom of God was at hand.” The force of this language
is not controlled by any means, by reference to the day’s following
the night, and the springing up of the fruits of the earth, from the sowing
of the seed.</p>

McAlister dated February 24, 1746, are now in the possession of Jonathan

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[3]</a> One other correction should be made. Judge Waite arbitrarily assigns
Cerinthus to the year 145. He gives no reason or authority for it. It is
the testimony of all antiquity that Cerinthus was contemporary with the
Apostle John, and that John died about the year 100. Irenæus, upon the
authority of Polycarp, says that John, being about to enter a bath and finding
Cerinthus within, drew back saying: “Let us even be gone lest the
bath should fall to pieces,—Cerinthus, that enemy of the truth, being
within.” See Vol. II., Encyclopedia of McClintock and Strong, p. 190.</p>

<span class="smaller">INTEGRITY OF THE GOSPELS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>As stated in former chapters, this is to be presumed till
the contrary is shown. There is, however, strong confirmation
from many sources.</p>

<p><i>First.</i>—The writings of the Apostolic Fathers present to
our view the Christ of the Gospels, in his advent and life,
ministry and teaching, death and resurrection. In particular,
his resurrection from the dead is cited by Clement (A.D. 97)
as an earnest of that of his followers, and as a proof that he
came forth from God. The greatest of miracles, and the
central fact of Christianity, appears in the earliest writings
(outside of the New Testament), the date of which can be
determined. Judge Waite, in his “wonderful hundred<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> years
of silence by Christian writers” concerning the miracles of
Christ, is oblivious of what he had before stated, that aside
from the Gospels, there are left of the first century “only the
Epistles of Paul, the one Epistle of Clement of Rome, some
slight notices by Jewish and heathen writers, and the few
legends and traditions preserved in the writings of the Fathers.”
Such an argument from silence, <i>where there are no
writings extant</i>, is not befitting <i>a judge</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>—The earliest quotations substantially agree with
the Canonical Gospels. Some of those by Justin Martyr
have been given in chapters five and six, and those by
Clement may be found in the Note.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> These quotations by
Apostolic and Christian Fathers, afford ample<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> means for
comparison, and no variations appear to indicate any changes
to affect the character or teachings of our Lord. Professor
Fisher says<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of <i>Justin’s</i> references, that they embrace “not
more” than two sayings of Jesus that have not substantial
parallels in the four Evangelists. The first is, “In what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
things I shall apprehend you, in these will I judge you,”
which is found also in Clement of Alexandria, and Hippolytus.
The second is, “There shall be schisms and heresies,” a prediction
referred also to Christ by Tertullian. These sayings
may have come from <i>tradition</i>. It seems not improbable that
they were current expressions, embodying what Jesus taught<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
respecting the standard by which men shall be judged according
to the light which they have received, and divisions in
the same household. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">cc. 6 to 8</a> <i>ante</i>).</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>—The facts in Christ’s history referred to by the
Fathers, with very rare exceptions (the most of which were
stated and explained in chapter seven), correspond with the
Evangelists. The exceptional facts are such as would naturally
have been derived from tradition, and they in no way
change the life or character of our Lord as they appear in
the Gospels. The marvel is, that they should be so few and
unimportant, considering that some of the writers lived at a
time when<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “traditionary reminiscences must have possessed
all their freshness.”</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>—Marcion’s Gospel (written as early as the year
145), except in intentional omissions and mutilations, for
which he was sharply called to an account by Tertullian,
presents a substantial agreement with Luke’s Gospel. Judge
Waite claims that it was earlier than Luke’s; but the almost
unanimous verdict of scholars is against him. Indeed, Professor
Fisher, in the March number of the <i>Princeton Review</i>
for 1881 (p. 217), says: “That Marcion’s Gospel was an
abridgment of our Luke is <i>now conceded on all hands</i>, even
by the author of ‘Supernatural Religion.’ Dr. Sanday has
not only demonstrated this by a linguistic argument, but has
proved by a comparison of texts that the Gospel of the Canon
must have been for some time in use, and have attained to a
considerable circulation, before Marcion applied to it his
pruning-knife. There is no reason to doubt that he took for
his purpose a Gospel of established authority in the Church.”
Professor Curtiss also says that “the weight of scholarship is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
overwhelmingly in favor of the priority of Luke.” And he
quotes from the last edition of the “Supernatural Religion,”
the admission referred to by Professor Fisher. Its anonymous
author says that Dr. Sanday’s very able examination “has
convinced us that our earlier hypothesis is untenable; that the
portions of our third Synoptic, excluded from Marcion’s
Gospel, were really written by the same pen which composed
the mass of the work; and, consequently, that our third
Synoptic existed in his time, and was substantially in the
hands of Marcion.” Dr. Sanday<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> shows, as he expresses
it, that Marcion’s Gospel stands to Luke’s “entirely in the
relation of <i>defect</i>. We may say entirely, for the additions are
so insignificant—some thirty words in all, and those for the
most part supported by other authority—that for practical
purposes they are not to be reckoned. With the exception
of these thirty words inserted, and also some slight alterations
of phrase, Marcion’s Gospel presents simply an <i>abridgment</i>
of our St. Luke.” That Marcion’s Gospel was not one of
Justin’s “Memoirs,” is plain from his calling him a wolf,<a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
“sent forth by the devil.” Although Marcion’s Gospel is
not in existence, except as reproduced from the works of
Tertullian and Epiphanius, its agreement with Luke (with
the exceptions which they pointed out) becomes important
evidence that Luke is to-day as it was in the year one hundred
and forty-five.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>—Our Gospels and Acts before the close of the
second century of our era were translated into other languages,
and the Syriac, Coptic and Latin versions which have
come down to us with some imperfections and slight variations,
are in substantial agreement with our present version
in all that is material. A translation of a given date presumably
represents a text of greater age than itself. Hence the
manuscripts from which these translations were made were
older than the year two hundred, and probably older than the
year one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i>—The early and continued multiplication of copies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
affords strong evidence. Those who copied from originals
deemed authentic would certainly endeavor to make exact
copies. As these Memoirs were read in all the churches,
and, doubtless, in Christian families and Christian schools,
they soon became very numerous. There was fraternal intercourse
between the churches. Any substantial difference
in the copies would be noticed. Any such differences would
be transmitted in copies made from these copies, and so on, to
the manuscripts which have reached us. The number of copies
before the tenth persecution (commenced A.D. 300, and lasting
ten years) must have reached many thousands.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> So complete
was then supposed to be the extinction of Christianity,
that coins were struck and inscriptions set up, recording the
fact, that the “Christian superstition” was now utterly exterminated,
and the worship of the gods restored by Diocletian,
who assumed the name of Jupiter, and Maximian, who
took that of Hercules. This persecution, in addition to the
destruction of life, was specially<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> directed to the destruction
of copies of the Scriptures.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i>—Constantine, their successor, in the year 331,
caused fifty copies of the Scriptures to be made for Byzantium,
under the care of Eusebius of Cæsarea, the church historian.
The manuscript discovered by the celebrated Tischendorf,
in 1859, at the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount
Sinai, is believed to be one of those copies, and to be the
oldest<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Greek manuscript in existence. <i>If</i> one of the fifty, it
is more than fifteen hundred years old. It is called the
Sinaitic Codex. The second rank belongs to the Vatican
Codex. Its date is probably not later than the fourth century.
The next in the order of time is the Alexandrian Codex.
Its date is the latter part of the fourth century or the
beginning of the fifth century. The Vatican has been in the
Vatican Library since 1445. The Alexandrian was sent, in
1628, by the Patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles I., and
is now in the British Museum. The Sinaitic was presented
by its discoverer to the Emperor of Russia. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
doubt whatever that these three manuscripts were written
back of the “dark ages,” and at a time when the true text
could be known with great exactness, and was comparatively
free from errors. With these, there are fifty manuscripts
that are a thousand years old. There are, it is estimated,
more than seventeen hundred manuscripts of the whole, or
portions, of the New Testament, ranging in date from the
fourth to the sixteenth century. Providence, says Tischendorf,
has ordained for the New Testament more sources of
the greatest antiquity than are possessed by all the old Greek
literature put together. The number of manuscripts of the
Greek Classics, says<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Professor Stowe, is very small compared
with the Greek Testament manuscripts, and the oldest
of them scarcely reaches nine hundred years. There are such
differences between the Sinaitic, Vatican, and Alexandrian
manuscripts as indicate that no two of them were taken from
the same original. A little reflection will convince any one,
that while no single copy may be literally exact from its
original, the multiplication of copies adds greatly to substantial
accuracy as the result of the whole. For although there
is a tendency to a repetition of <i>some</i> errors, by different copyists
from the same original, as where successive sentences end
with the same word, yet, in general, different copyists would
make different errors, one in one part of the instrument, and
the other in another, and, where the copies are numerous,
they mutually correct each other. So it happens that in the
different manuscripts of the New Testament, with different
readings of many thousands (counting all trifles, like the
omission to dot an <i>i</i> or cross a <i>t</i> in English chirography, as
different readings), there is substantial agreement. It is a
fact to be emphasized, says<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Professor Fisher, “that the
Scriptures are almost utterly free from wilful corruption;”
and he endorses the opinion of the great critic, Bentley, that
the real text “is competently exact in the worst manuscripts
now extant; nor is one article of faith or moral precept either
perverted or lost in them.” And examining the subject in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
hand from a lawyer’s standpoint, the <i>worst</i> manuscript, or
translation, or version, is sufficient for the purposes of the
argument. And to cite once more the great authority of
Professor Greenleaf,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to the genuineness of the Four Gospels:
“The entire text of the Corpus Juris Civilis is received
as authority in all the courts of Continental Europe, upon
much weaker evidence of its genuineness; for the integrity of
the Sacred Text has been preserved by the jealousy of opposing
sects beyond any moral possibility of corruption; while
that of the Roman Civil Law has been preserved only by
tacit consent, without the interest of any opposing school to
watch over and preserve it from alteration.”</p>

<p>And now (1882) the New Revision, both of the text and
of the translation, by scholars who have no superior, and the
careful product of ten years’ labor, has been long enough
before the world to know the results. Not a single fact or
witness to the Resurrection is lost, and not a single doctrine
is changed, while many passages are better understood.</p>

should be burned; those who held places of honor and rank must renounce
their faith, or be degraded; those belonging to the lower walks of private
life to be divested of their rights as citizens and freemen; slaves were to

<span class="smaller">THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EVANGELISTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The question of their credibility is before that of their
inspiration. If uninspired, they may have given us everything
essential to the determination of Christ’s resurrection.
If inspired, inspiration may have been bestowed in such a
manner as to leave them subject to some of the limitations of
human testimony. If reliable accounts of the life, teachings,
death, and resurrection, of our Lord, were to be published to
the world, it was of the last importance that they should not
carry upon their face the appearance of collusion and contrivance.
Let any one who is disturbed by any seeming contradictions
or errors, consider for a moment what would be
the consequence if they did not exist. If each writer
narrated the same occurrences and teachings and in the same
terms, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
believe that they were independent witnesses. And so, if
each should give all of the same occurrences and teachings,
although in different terms, or a part of them, but in the same
terms, it would be almost as difficult to believe that we have
independent witnesses. As it is, no question can arise.
Neither of them covers the whole ground, and where the
same matters appear, it is, in general, except in brief passages
easily remembered, in different terms. We are <i>sure</i> there
was no collusion. We are sure we have the testimony of
independent writers. This is conceded. Says Judge Waite (pp.
311, 313): That the Gospels “are not merely copied one from
the other, with changes, is the almost unanimous verdict of
Biblical scholars.” And in this, he expresses the verdict of
those who reject, not less than of those who accept the Gospels.
Among the limitations attending mere human testimony,
are, that, ordinarily, no witness will state the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
any transaction, and no two witnesses will state it in precisely
the same terms, unless there is fraud or collusion, and the
testimony of each is but the recital of something that has
been committed to memory. Another limitation is, that
even with two or more witnesses, errors to some extent will
come in. There will be some lack of correct observation, or
some misrecollection,—not only the omission of a part, but
positive misstatement by one or more of the witnesses. The
whole transaction is to be gathered <i>from all</i> the witnesses.
And the law, having respect to human infirmities, says it
is enough in all cases to prove the <i>substance</i> of words alleged
to have been spoken, or the substance of the issue, in any
civil or criminal cause; immaterial errors of time, or place, or
distance, or other circumstance, will be disregarded. Now it
is <i>conceivable</i> that the Evangelists, under the guidance of the
Divine Spirit, may have been left (to some extent) subject to
these limitations, in order that their testimony, conforming to
these laws of observation and memory, be the more credible.
Hence, whether the Evangelists, in this stage of the inquiry,
be regarded as inspired or uninspired, it is labor lost, to
adduce alleged errors<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or contradictions which, if made out,
could not seriously affect their honesty and general competency.
In order that a witness receive our confidence, we
should be satisfied of his means of knowledge, his capacity to
ascertain the facts, and his disposition to give a correct
account of them. Two of the writers, Matthew and John,
were of the twelve (and John was the beloved disciple) and
hence they had the best possible means of knowing the facts.
Matthew, from his business of a tax-gatherer, may be presumed
to have been sharp, shrewd and observant. John,
from his most intimate association, was pre-eminently qualified
to give testimony. He gives it with solemnity equal to
an oath: “And he that saw bare record, and his record is
true; and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might
believe” (c. xix. 35). “And many other signs truly did
Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
in this book; but these are written, that ye might believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing,
ye might have life through his name” (c. xx. 30, 31). Again,
after stating what Peter asked concerning the disciple
“whom Jesus loved,” and what followed, it is said: “This is
the disciple which testifieth of these things, and who wrote
these things; and we<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> know that his testimony is true” (c.
xxi. 20-24). This Gospel, obviously written later than the
others, omits much that is contained in them, and is, so to
speak, of higher order. The first incident mentioned in it, is
the witness borne to Christ by the Baptist. It gives none of
the parables, so abundant in the Synoptics.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It relates but
two of the miracles recorded in them, <i>i. e.</i> the feeding of the
five thousand, and the walking upon the water, (c. vi. 1-21).
It adds six miracles not recorded in the Synoptics (among
which is the raising of Lazarus), numerous conversations and
discourses of the greatest interest, and facts relating to the
crucifixion and resurrection, of great weight as evidence. It
is written in purer Greek than the others; its style<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is elegant
and graceful; it gives every indication of calm, thoughtful and
deliberate composition, and in these respects tends to confirm
the uniform tradition that it was the ripe product of a mind and
heart, enriched, quickened, and vitalized, by familiar intercourse
with our Lord and the truths which he declared, as well
as by the Spirit promised to the Apostles. Men with favorable
native gifts, become educated fast under such influences.</p>

<p>It affords about the only means for a connected chronological
history of our Lord’s ministry, which is seen to have
embraced a longer<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> period, than could have been ascertained
from the Synoptics.</p>

<p>Although Mark was not one of the twelve, the character of
his Gospel in its life-like description of events, and its
omitting nothing<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> where Peter was prominent, confirms the
tradition, that he was an attendant upon Peter’s ministry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and was his interpreter. Nine-tenths<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the incidents
related in Mark are also recorded in the other Gospels.</p>

<p>Luke was an educated man, and, as he incidentally discloses,
a companion of Paul in a part of his journeyings. His
Gospel was evidently drawn up with great care. In the prologue
(c. i. 1-5) he gives a reason for his writing, and the
sources of his information. “Many have taken in hand to set
forth in order a declaration of those things which are most
surely believed among us.” These things, he says, “were
delivered unto us by those who from the beginning were eye
witnesses and ministers of the Word.” He was stimulated to
give an additional narrative (“having had perfect understanding
of all things from the very first”) for the satisfaction
of his friend, Theophilus, and in order that he might know
“the <i>certainty</i> of those things,” wherein he had been
instructed. No historian could enter upon his work in a
better spirit, or with more excellent qualifications and opportunities.
In a subsequent treatise which in terms refers to
the former, he finds nothing to retract or qualify. Can any
one tell why Luke, as a historian, is not entitled to as much
credit as Josephus?</p>

<p>In comparing the Gospels with each other, or with
Josephus, it should be constantly borne in mind, that
<i>omission</i> (except under special circumstances) <i>is not contradiction</i>.
The facts of history, like the conclusions of a jury,
are to be drawn from all credible sources, and the transaction
deemed to be as shown upon <i>all</i> the evidence. <i>Positive</i>
testimony from a single witness may prove a fact against the
<i>negative</i> testimony of any number of witnesses, who are silent
upon the subject.</p>

<p>It is also to be remembered that the Gospels are not so
much connected histories, as reminiscences of events and
teachings, with but little regard (sometimes an utter disregard)
to their chronological order. Neither Gospel is, of itself,
any approach to a connected history from Christ’s birth to
his ascension. The events, so far as known to us, are to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
gathered <i>from them all</i>. Mark begins with the Baptist at the
river Jordan, and John at about the same time. It is not to
be inferred that they knew nothing of the infancy, or childhood,
or young manhood of Jesus. Matthew omits the
presentation at the temple, the vision to the Shepherds,
and other incidents; and Luke omits the visit of the Wise
men, the slaying of the children, the flight into Egypt, and
other incidents. But in so doing, neither contradicts the
other; nor does Josephus, by his silence concerning these
events, contradict the Evangelists. He may have been
ignorant of some of these events, for he was not born until
the year 37, and, being a Jew and not a Christian, he might
not choose to mention those which had come to his knowledge.</p>

<p>Luke’s Gospel may or may not have made use of writings
then in existence relating to Christ (but which never found
general acceptance), and the same is true of the First and
Second Gospels. <i>It is no impeachment of their credibility.</i>
Every historian makes such use of materials that he deems
reliable, as best answers his purpose, and his history is none
the less trustworthy on that account. Hence, as a matter of
evidence, it is of no consequence how many or how few, previous
manuscripts may be traced in our Gospels, or either of
them. Such writings had an ephemeral existence, never
came into general use, and the Four Gospels and no others
were the accepted Gospels in all the churches. Whatever
literature of the kind preceded them perished so early that
it cannot be told when it disappeared, or what was its character
or completeness.</p>

<p>The Evangelists give every mark of honest witnesses.
Their story is simple, straightforward and unimpassioned,
even under circumstances calculated to arouse resentment.
They seem intent upon nothing but the giving of a truthful
narrative, not sparing themselves or extenuating their own
faults. Their frequent incidental allusions to matters of government,
custom, nationality, etc., and minuteness of detail,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
are such as would never be found in false witnesses. “A false
witness,” says Mr. Greenleaf, “will not willingly detail any
circumstances in which his testimony will be open to contradiction,
nor multiply them where there is danger of being detected
by a comparison of them with other accounts equally
circumstantial.”</p>

<p>It would detract nothing from the credit of the Evangelists,
if, in the multitude of their incidental references, error
should be found in a few of them, for some error is inseparable
from all human productions; and their inspiration may not
have been so circumstantial as to exclude immaterial errors.</p>

<p>With such differences as show most convincingly that
the Evangelists are independent witnesses, there is such
unity in the character and life of Christ, as exhibited by them,
as shows the same <i>original</i> for the likeness. This essential
unity of the Gospel is evidenced by the fact that not a single
church or communion exists, that does not accept <i>all</i> the Gospels,
if <i>either</i>.</p>

<p>From internal evidence, it is extremely probable that the
Synoptics were written before the destruction of Jerusalem.
Luke was certainly written before Acts, and the history in
Acts is not carried later than the year 62, eight years before
that event. As the four undisputed Epistles were all written
before the year 60, the logical order will be to present the
testimony of Paul to the Resurrection before that of the
Evangelists.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="label">[1]</a> President Bartlett believes that notwithstanding its long line of exposure,
the outer historical difficulties seem reduced to the solitary question
of the taxing under Cyrenius. (The <i>Princeton Review</i> for January, 1880,
p. 44.) Aside from any question of inspiration, it is improbable that Luke
made a mistake. Justin Martyr, who wrote at a very early period, in his
Apology to the Roman Emperor, refers to this taxing as a well known
event (Ap., c. 34). He again refers to it in his Dialogue (c. 78) as being the
first census taken in Judea under Cyrenius. Celsus, who was not wanting
in skill or inclination to attack at all points, found no occasion here. It
may well be that a person holding the office which Cyrenius held at the
first enrolment was called a “procurator.” Or Luke in speaking of this
enrolment may have referred to Cyrenius by the title which he afterwards
bore; or Cyrenius may have been in the office twice. President Bartlett
also concludes with Warrenton that there is not any instance of a really
inapposite quotation from the Old Testament, although the quotations are
sometimes inaccurate. He also concludes that the instances of alleged
<i>contradictions</i> may be reduced to five, and that there is no insurmountable
difficulty in reconciling them. But, for reasons stated in the text, the inquiry
is not material to our argument.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE APOCALYPSE AND THE FOUR EPISTLES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>While all Infidels, from Celsus before the year 180 to Waite,
in 1881, have agreed that “either Jesus was not really dead,
or he did not really rise again,” some<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of them have assumed
the one, and some the other alternative. Strauss, with Celsus,
doubts the reality of the resurrection, rather than the death.
Schleiermacher, on the other hand, held that Jesus returned
again to life from a state of lethargy; and this view, although
not the position generally taken by skeptics, is still held by a
very few.</p>

<p>There have been two institutions in the Christian church,
the Lord’s Supper and the Lord’s day, that have testified from
the beginning that Jesus was really dead, and did really rise
again from the dead. They displaced the Jewish Passover
and the Jewish Sabbath, both strongly entrenched in the law
of Moses and long established custom. Such substitution can
be accounted for, only upon the hypothesis of the fullest conviction
of the death and resurrection of our Lord. The Lord’s
day is referred to by Paul in First Corinthians (c. xvi.) under the
designation of “the first day of the week,” and is mentioned
by John in Revelation (c. i. 10), where he says, “I was in
the Spirit on the Lord’s Day.” The Lord’s Supper has great
prominence given to it by Paul in the eleventh chapter of
First Corinthians. Those to whom he writes are admonished
not to eat “of that bread,” or drink “of that cup,” in an unworthy
manner, “For as often as ye eat this bread and drink
this cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.” As to
the origin of this sacrament, he says, “I have received of the
Lord that which I also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus
the same night in which he was betrayed took bread, and when
he had given thanks, he brake and said, Take, eat; this is my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
body broken for you; this do in remembrance of me: and
after the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
supped, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood;
this do ye as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.” This
Epistle was written as early as the year<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> 57, or within 27 years
after the Crucifixion. It is not to be doubted that such a
command would be observed from the first formation of any
church. Both the death and resurrection of Christ appear in
the book of Revelation. He is called “The first begotten of
the dead” (c. i. 5), “He that liveth and was dead” (c. i. 88),
“The Lamb as it had been slain,” before whom the four living
creatures and the elders (as representing the whole Church) fall
down, saying, “Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open
the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us
to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation” (c. v. 6 to 10). And John says that he
was in exile, “for the Word of God, and for the testimony of
Jesus Christ” (c. i. 9). What was this “testimony,” other
than that which Luke says in Acts (c. iv. 2) was given by
Peter and John when the Sadducees were “grieved that they
taught the people, and preached through Jesus Christ the resurrection
from the dead;” or other than that, given by Peter
in the presence of John, (c. iii. 15) that the Jews had “killed
the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead;
<i>whereof we are witnesses</i>.” Even from the book of Revelation<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
alone, were there no other proof, should we conclude that
<i>John</i> testified that Jesus died and rose again.</p>

<p>This was the burden of <i>Paul’s</i> preaching and the inspiration
of his life.</p>

<p>Nor do we stop with Paul. From his writings we know
that all the Apostles and the whole Church from the beginning,
maintained the same grand theme with all the strength
of conviction of which men are capable. He had been
preaching three years prior to the first visit to Jerusalem referred
to in Galatians (c. i. 18). At this visit he had “returned
again,” to Damascus. His leaving Damascus was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
probably the time when he was let down from the wall in a
basket, as stated in Second Corinthians (c. xi. 33), and the
city was then held “under Aretus the King.” Fourteen years
after his conversion or his escape (it is uncertain which), he
went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with
him. The precise date of his conversion is unknown, but was
approximately<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the year 36. He writes of the last visit
mentioned in Galatians, “that when James, Cephas and John,
who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given
unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of
fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto
the circumcision.” From that time, then, if not before, with
the full recognition of all the Apostles, he became distinctively
the Apostle to the Gentiles. And at the first visit mentioned,
he saw James, the Lord’s brother, and also Peter, and abode
with him fifteen days. Afterwards, he went into the regions
of Syria and Cilicia, and was unknown by face unto the
churches of Judea, but they had heard, “That he which persecuted
us in times past now preacheth the faith which once
he destroyed;” and he says, “they glorified God in me”
(c. i. 18-24). He says in the thirteenth verse, “Ye have
heard of my conversation in time past, in the Jews’ religion,
how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and
wasted it.”</p>

<p>As there is no doubt what “the faith” was, which he
preached after his conversion, so there is no doubt what
“the faith” was “which once he destroyed.” Within three
years after the commencement of his ministry, he saw
James the Lord’s brother, and abode with Peter fifteen days;
and at the expiration of the fourteen years, <i>all</i> the Apostles
were ready to give him the right hand of fellowship. As
there is no doubt what “faith” <i>he</i> preached (which was the
same which he had destroyed), so there is none as to what
faith the <i>others</i> preached, and <i>had</i> preached from the beginning.
<i>His conversion was within six years of the Crucifixion.</i>
As he from that time preached Jesus and the Resurrection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
there is no doubt but that Jesus and the Resurrection were
preached during the six years before his conversion. Hence,
from Paul’s four Epistles (whose genuineness is beyond controversy),
we are inevitably carried back to the first ministry
of <i>any</i> of the Apostles, for the time when the doctrine of the
Resurrection was <i>first</i> proclaimed. This conclusion is
reached without recourse to the testimony of either of the
Evangelists; and believers may say with Renan, though in
a different spirit, “Thanks to the Epistle to the Galatians!”
If from this Epistle the <i>precise</i> commencement of the ministry
of Peter and John cannot be determined, it must be inferred
that it was before, and apparently some time before, Paul’s
conversion, which, as has been seen, was <i>within six years</i>
of the Crucifixion. For this reason, as well as many others,
the importance of Paul’s testimony can hardly be overestimated.</p>

<p>But in order that its full force may be better apprehended,
it may be useful to present it more in detail, as: In Romans
“God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were
yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. v. 8); “Christ being
raised from the dead, dieth no more” (Rom. vi. 9); “Christ
that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at the
right hand of God” (Rom. viii. 34); “Declared to be the
Son of God, with power according to the spirit of holiness,
by the resurrection from the dead” (Rom. i. 4); “The word
is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is the
word of faith which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with
thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart
<i>that God hath raised him from the dead</i>, thou shalt be saved”
(Rom. x. 8, 9); And to the Galatians—“Paul, an Apostle,
not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God
the Father who <i>raised him from the dead</i>” (Gal. i. 1); And
to the Corinthians—“Now if Christ be preached that he
rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is
no resurrection of the dead!” “But if there be no resurrection
of the dead, then is <i>Christ</i> not risen;” “And if Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is
also vain;” “Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God
because we have <i>testified</i> of God that he raised up Christ,
whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not”
(1 Cor. xv. 12 to 16); “For I delivered unto you FIRST OF
ALL that which I also received, how that Christ died for
our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was
buried, and that he rose again the third day according
to the Scriptures; and that he was seen of Cephas, then
of the twelve; after that he was seen of about five hundred
brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain unto
this present, but some are fallen asleep; after that he was
seen of James; then of all the Apostles; and last of all he
was seen of me also, as one born out of due time; for I am
the least of the Apostles and am not meet to be called an
Apostle because I persecuted the Church of God” (1 Cor.
xv. 3-10).</p>

<p>We know not with what body Jesus appeared to Paul six
years after his ascension; nor with what body or just when
his saints shall rise. But when Paul says that Christ, having
died for our sins, was <i>buried</i> and rose again the <i>third day</i>,
and was seen by those enumerated, it would be a most violent
perversion of language to infer that it was not a <i>material</i>
resurrection. His flesh had not then seen corruption, and he
had not yet ascended. The state of things had changed at
the time he was seen by Paul, and hence the mode of his
appearance was different. Paul could not have been ignorant
that the Apostles were persuaded that they beheld and
handled the corporeal body of their risen Lord, and if he
had entertained a different idea of the character of the appearances
to them, he could not have written as we have
quoted. As will be shown in subsequent chapters, he had
“received,” a corporeal resurrection, and so he “delivered.”</p>

<p>These four Epistles of Paul were written about A.D. 58, or
within less than thirty years from the Crucifixion. By them,
two things are established beyond dispute. <i>First</i>, the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of the Resurrection, whether true or false, is not a <i>myth
or legend</i>, in any sense in which those words are commonly understood,
or in any sense in which they should ever be used.
Nor are the appearances or <i>supposed</i> appearances of our risen
Lord, mentioned by Paul (whether they be regarded as real
or not), <i>myths or legends</i>. The <i>doctrine</i> of the Resurrection
was not the product of a subsequent age; it was received
from the beginning. Nor were the <i>appearances</i> of our risen
Lord, which were the basis of that doctrine, the product of
a subsequent age. A skeptic, if he will or must, may say
that the doctrine is not true, and that the appearances which
were accepted as evidence of it were not real; but he cannot
without an abuse of language say that the one, or the others,
are <i>myths or legends</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, the Apostles and early disciples most intensely
believed the doctrine to be true, and the appearances to be
real. Even Strauss is compelled to admit their sincerity.
He concedes that the Epistle to the Corinthians is undoubtedly
genuine. And he says that on its authority, “One must
believe that many members of the primitive church who were
yet living at the time when this Epistle was written, especially
the Apostles, were convinced that they had witnessed
appearances of the risen Christ.” (Strauss’ Life, etc., p. 832.)
And this is generally conceded by all skeptics at the present
day who have any claim to be even tolerably informed upon
the subject of the Resurrection, and any disposition to deal
with it in any spirit of fairness. This narrows our inquiry
very much. Thus far we rest on solid ground. We start
with the fact fully established, that we are not dealing with
myths, or legends, concerning a remote transaction. We
know precisely what convictions in respect to the Resurrection
were entertained at the very time of the transaction, by
those best qualified to judge; and we also know many of the
facts, upon which these convictions were based. We may
say, if we choose, that the supposed appearances were not
real; but we cannot say they are an <i>afterthought</i>. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
must have been entertained from the very beginning, certainly
as early as the day of Pentecost. The Apostles believed
with most intense earnestness, that they had seen their
<i>Risen Lord</i>, and had received from him their Commission to
disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Their honesty being conceded, the only question remaining
is, <i>were they deceived</i>? Mistake on their part could only
have been in one or two things; either that he did not die
upon the cross, or else that he was not alive afterward. And
here it is important to observe, that the Evangelists do little
more than give to some extent the times and circumstances
of transactions already declared, in the Epistles, to have
occurred. Of course those transactions as they were understood
when the Epistles were written, <i>had</i> their times and
circumstances. Paul declared what he had “received,”—that
Jesus <i>died</i> and was <i>buried</i>. The Gospels state the time
and the attending circumstances. Paul declared, as he had
“received,”—that Christ <i>rose again the third day</i>. The Gospels
state the circumstances. Paul declared, as he had “received,”—that
Jesus after he rose on the third day, was seen
by Cephas, then by the twelve, after that by about five hundred
brethren, after that by James, and then again by all the
Apostles. The Gospels and the first chapter of Acts state
the circumstances of some, though not of all, of these several
appearances. From what we know already from Paul’s
Epistles, further information from some source should be
expected; and the Evangelists afford that information. We
must believe that they state the <i>circumstances</i>, as they were
understood when Paul wrote his Epistles, and as they were
understood when the Resurrection was first proclaimed on
the day of Pentecost. As the principal facts, <i>i. e.</i> the Resurrection
and subsequent visible appearances till the Ascension,
were not an afterthought, neither are the <i>circumstances</i>
attending them as recorded by the Evangelists,
an afterthought. In respect to these circumstances, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
can see and know what the Apostles <i>supposed</i> they saw, and
heard, and knew.</p>

<p>The Evangelists, therefore, by stating circumstances not
specified by Paul, enable us to determine more certainly,
whether the Apostles were deceived. And what they state
of Christ’s predictions of his death and his resurrection, may
also help us to determine whether the Apostles were deceived.</p>

<span class="smaller">HIS PREDICTIONS CONCERNING HIMSELF.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the account of Christ’s crucifixion by Matthew and
Mark, it is recorded that they which passed by railed on him,
saying,—“Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in
three days, save thyself”; and that witnesses had testified to
the same accusation, but did not agree. The disagreement
seems to have been, that some (Mark xiv. 58) testified that
he said,—“I will destroy this temple that is made with
hands and in three days I will build another made without
hands,” and the others (Matthew xxvi. 61) “I am able to destroy
the temple of God and to build it in three days.” The Evangelists
properly characterize both classes as <i>false</i> witnesses.
Jesus had not said, “<i>I will</i> destroy,” nor “I am <i>able</i> to destroy,”
but, “Destroy (<i>thou</i>) this temple.” It was not a
destroying by <i>him</i>, but by <i>them</i>; and it was the temple of
his own body. It was the earliest, and in some respects the
most striking of his predictions of his death and resurrection.
It was on the occasion of his cleansing the temple at the first
Passover. The Jews demanded of him, “What sign showest
thou unto us, seeing thou doest these things?” Jesus said,
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.” The
Jews therefore said, “Forty and six years was this temple in
building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? But he
spake of the temple of his body. When, therefore, he was
raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he spake
this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which
Jesus had said.” (John ii. 13 to 22.)</p>

<p>It must have been soon after this Passover, and certainly
before John the Baptist was cast into prison, that Jesus said
to Nicodemus, that, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life. (John iii.
14, 15.) Nicodemus does not appear again, until his mild
protest to the rest of the Sanhedrim,—“Doth our law judge
a man except it first hear from himself, and know what he
doeth?”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They answered and said unto him, “Art thou also
of Galilee? Search and see that out of Galilee ariseth no
prophet.” He was silent. (John viii. 45 to 52.) But when
Jesus had been put to death as a malefactor, no longer afraid,
he comes with Joseph of Arimathea, bringing a mixture of
myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight, and they
gave the Crucified One a princely burial. (John xix. 39, 40,
41.) What had wrought this change in Nicodemus? The
lifting up upon the cross, was to <i>him</i> assured proof that Jesus
was a true “prophet, and more than a prophet.”</p>

<p>On more than one occasion in his early ministry, Jesus in
reply to a demand for a sign from heaven had said, “There
shall no sign be given but the sign of Jonah the prophet;
for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of
the whale, so shall the Son of man be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth.” (Matthew xii. 38 to 40;
Luke xi. 29.) That he should be there only three days and
three nights implied his resurrection. To any objection that
he was not in the tomb any part of three nights, the customary<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
use of language among the Jews is a sufficient answer.
In the <i>Talm hieros</i>, it is said that a day and a night
together make up a period; and a part of such a period is
counted as the whole. It is a received<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> rule among the Jews
that a part of a day is put for the whole. Yet that the prediction
was expressed in such terms, is strong evidence of
the truthfulness of the record. As Godet well says, “Who
would ever have dreamed of <i>falsely</i> putting in the mouth of
Jesus the expression three days and three nights, when in
actual fact the time spent in the tomb did not exceed one
day and two nights?”</p>

<p>Jesus, when called to account for healing on the Sabbath
day, answered: “My Father worketh even until now, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
work.” For this cause, therefore, the Jews sought the more
to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also
called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
In reply Jesus said: “For as the Father raiseth the dead,
and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he
will ... Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh
and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God; and they that hear shall live.... Marvel not at this,
for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tomb shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done
good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
ill, unto the resurrection of judgment.” (John v. 1 to 29.)</p>

<p>In his discourse in the Synagogue at Capernaum, concerning
the manna, he said to the Jews: “The bread which I
give is my flesh (that is, my life), for the life of the world....
For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed....
Many therefore of his disciples when they heard,
said, ‘This is a hard saying; who can hear it?’ But Jesus
knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said
unto them, ‘Doth this cause you to stumble? <i>What</i> then
if ye behold the Son of man ascending where he was before.’”
(John vi. 30 to 63.)</p>

<p>His first distinct announcement that he should be put to
death and be raised from the dead, was upon Peter’s confession,— “Thou
art the Christ the Son of the living God;”
and it doubtless was in consequence of this confession. It
was after John the Baptist had been put to death, and after
the third Passover, but before the time had come for a public
declaration of his Messiahship; for he charged the disciples
that they should tell no man that he was the Christ. The place
was in the coast of Cesarea Philippi, near the sources of the Jordan.
With verbal differences, the same account substantially
is given by each of the Synoptics, and as follows: “From that
time began Jesus to show unto his disciples, how that he
must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders
and chief priests and scribes, and the third day be raised up.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
(Matthew xvi. 21.) “And he began to teach them that the
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the
elders and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed,
and after three days rise again.” (Mark viii. 31.) “The Son
of Man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders
and the chief priests and scribes and be killed, and the third
day be raised up.” (Luke ix. 22.) Such is the testimony of
these three witnesses. They agree also, that he warned the
disciples not to anticipate worldly glory, but the reverse.
Peter, from <i>his</i> conception of the Messiahship, treated
Christ’s predictions of his death as but gloomy forebodings,
and began to rebuke him, saying, “Be it far from thee, Lord;
this shall never be unto thee.” But he turned and said unto
Peter, “Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art a stumbling
block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of God but
the things of men.” (Matthew xvi. 23; Mark viii. 33.)</p>

<p>Six or eight days after these transactions Jesus took with
him Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to
pray; and he was transfigured before them. As they were
coming down from the mountain “he commanded them to tell
the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen from the
dead.” (Matthew xvii. 1, 2; Mark viii. 2 to 9; Luke ix. 28
to 36.) Mark adds (doubtless from Peter), that they kept that
saying, questioning among themselves, what the rising again
from the dead should mean.</p>

<p>Elijah’s appearance suggested to them the question, “Why
do the scribes say that Elijah must first come?” To which
Jesus replied, “Elijah is come already, and they knew him not,
but did unto him whatsoever they listed. Even so shall the
Son of Man also suffer of them.” Then understood the disciples
that he spake unto them of John the Baptist (Matthew xvii. 10
to 13). Mark (ix. 12 to 14) puts the reference to the Son of
Man in the form of a question: “And how is it written of
the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be
set at naught? But I say unto you that Elijah is come, and
they have also done unto him whatsoever they listed, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
as it is written of him.” In either form his own death is
predicted.</p>

<p>After the transfiguration he went to Capernaum, passing
through Galilee. “And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus
said unto them, ‘The Son of Man shall be delivered up into the
hands of men; and they shall kill him, and the third day he
shall be raised up.’ And they were exceeding sorry.” (Matthew
xvii. 22, 23.) “‘The Son of Man is delivered up into
the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is
killed, after three days he shall rise again.’ But they understood
not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.” (Mark
ix. 30 to 32.) “‘Let these words sink into your ears: for
the Son of Man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.’
But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from
them that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid
to ask him about this saying.” (Luke ix. 44, 45.) It is not
necessary to suppose that it was otherwise concealed than by
their dullness of apprehension, and preconceived opinions.</p>

<p>At the feast of Tabernacles, Jesus said to the officers
whom the Pharisees had sent to take him: “Yet a little
while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me. Ye
shall seek me and shall not find me: and where I am ye
cannot come.” (John vii. 32 to 35.)</p>

<p>He said the same to the Pharisees or the “Jews,” the day
following the feast as he taught in the temple; and they
said, “Will he kill himself, that he saith whither I go ye
cannot come?” In reply, after repeating his previous declaration,
he said, “When ye have lifted up the Son of Man,
then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of
myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone;
for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.” (John
viii. 21 to 30.)</p>

<p>In the parable of the good shepherd spoken soon after
the Feast, Jesus says: “I am the good shepherd ... and I
lay down my life for the sheep.... Therefore doth the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Father love me because I lay down my life that I may take
it again. No man taketh it away from me, but I lay it down
of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. This commandment received I of my
Father.” (John x. 11 to 18.)</p>

<p>He said to Martha, “I am the resurrection and the life;
he that believeth on me, though he die yet shall he live.”
(John xi. 25.)</p>

<p>As he was going up to Jerusalem to the Passover at which
he was to suffer, he again repeated his announcement to his
disciples. “Behold we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of
Man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes;
and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him
unto the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and
the third day he shall be raised up.” (Matthew xx. 18, 19.)
“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall
be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they
shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the
Gentiles; and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him,
and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three
days he shall rise again.” (Mark x. 33, 34.) “Behold we
go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the
prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of Man; for he
shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked,
and shamefully entreated, and spit upon; and they shall
scourge and kill him; and the third day he shall rise again.
And they understood none of these things; and this saying
was hid from them; and they perceived not the things that
were said.” (Luke xviii. 31 to 34.)</p>

<p>Immediately after (as it would seem), the mother of James
and John came with them with the request, that the sons
might sit one on his right hand, and one on his left hand, in
his kingdom. The ten were moved with indignation. But
Jesus said, “The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.”
(Matthew xx. 20 to 28; Mark x. 45.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Six days before the Passover, he came to Bethany, where
Lazarus was whom he had raised from the dead, and they
made him a supper in the house of Simon; and Mary (the
sister of Lazarus) anointed his head and feet with very precious
ointment. This excited the anger of Judas. Jesus
said, “Why trouble ye the woman, for she hath wrought a
good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you;
but me ye have not always, for in that she poured this ointment
upon my body she did it to prepare me for burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel shall be
preached in the whole world, that also which this woman
hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.” (Matthew
xxvi. 6 to 13; Mark xiv. 3 to 10; John xii. 2 to 8.)</p>

<p>Immediately after his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, on
the first day of the week of his crucifixion, he was told that
certain Greeks desired to see him. It was to him a sign of
his glorification among the Gentiles, and, therefore, of his
death. He answered, “The hour is come that the Son of
Man should be glorified. Verily, verily I say unto you, except
a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself
alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.... Now is my
soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour....
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
unto myself.” But this he said signifying by what manner of
death he should die.” (John xii. 20 to 22.)</p>

<p>The parable of the wicked husbandman (to be found in all
the Synoptics) represents them as killing the son and heir,
by whom, as the context shows, our Lord was intended.
And Jesus said, “Did ye never read in the Scriptures:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The stone which the builders rejected,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The same was made the head of the corner;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This was from the Lord,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Therefore, say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be
taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
forth the fruits thereof. And he that falleth on this stone
shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall,
it will scatter him as dust.” (Matthew xxi. 42 to 45; Mark
xii. 1 to 12; Luke xx. 9 to 10.)</p>

<p>And every day he was teaching in the temple; every night
he went out and lodged in the Mount of Olives till the third
day of the week (Tuesday) with which his public ministry
ended; and then he departed from the temple, never to
return.</p>

<p>When he had finished his teaching in the temple, he said
unto his disciples, “Ye know that after two days the Passover
cometh, and the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified.”
(Matthew xxvi. 2.)</p>

<p>Peter and John, as he had directed, made ready the Passover,
and when the hour was come, he sat down, and the
Apostles with him. And he said unto them, “With desire I
have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.”
(Luke xxii. 7 to 15.)</p>

<p>All the Evangelists state, that Jesus at the Passover supper
said to the twelve, “One of you shall betray me”; and two
of the Evangelists say that he designated the traitor, by the
giving of the sop. (Matthew xxvi. 21 to 25; Mark xiv. 18 to
21; Luke xxii. 21 to 23; John xiii. 21 to 35.)</p>

<p>After giving him the sop, Jesus said to Judas, “That thou
doest do quickly;” and he having received the sop, went
out straightway to carry out that which he had before agreed;
<i>and it was night</i>. (Luke xxii. 2 to 6; John xiii. 26 to 30.)</p>

<p>After Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him; and to Peter he
said, Whither I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou
shalt follow afterwards.” (John xii. 36, 37.)</p>

<p>To the institution of the Lord’s Supper, there is the testimony
of the three Synoptic Gospels, and that of Paul; four
witnesses; and its constant observance from that time to the
present. It was to commemorate his death to the end of the
world,—“Take, eat, this is my body.... Drink ye all of it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
for this is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many
unto remission of sins.” (Matthew xvii. 26 to 28.) “Take ye;
this is my body.” “This is my blood of the covenant which
is shed for many.” (Mark xiv. 22 to 25.) “This is my body
which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me....
This cup is the new covenant in my blood, <i>even</i> that which
is poured out for you.” (Luke xxii. 18 to 22.) “This is my
body, which is for you; this do in remembrance of me....
This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do as oft
as ye drink <i>it</i> in remembrance of me. For as often as ye
eat this bread and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s
death till he come.” (1 Corinthians xi. 23 to 28.)</p>

<p>To his saying that he would go before them into Galilee
after his resurrection, there are <i>two</i> witnesses. It was after
they had sung their hymn, and had gone out unto the Mount
of Olives. “All ye shall be offended in me this night; for
it is written I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the
flock shall be scattered abroad. But after I am raised up I
will go before you into Galilee.” So, Matthew. Mark’s
account is: “And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be
offended; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and
the sheep shall be scattered abroad. Howbeit after I am
raised up I will go before you into Galilee.” (Matthew xxvi.
31, 32; Mark xiv. 27, 28.)</p>

<p>That Peter should thrice deny that he knew him, is proved
by <i>all</i> the Evangelists. “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, that
this night before the cock crow<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> thou shalt deny me thrice.”
(Matthew xxvi. 34, 35.) “I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall
not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou
knowest me.” (Luke xxii. 34.) “Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.”
(John xiii. 38.) Mark (probably from Peter himself) says
that when Peter said, “Although all should be offended, yet
will not I,” Jesus said to him, “Verily I say unto thee, that
thou to-day, <i>even</i> this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt
deny me thrice.” “But he spake exceeding vehemently, If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like
manner said they all.” (Mark xiv. 26 to 31.)</p>

<p>Yet in the discourse which followed, Jesus again says,
“Behold the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be
scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone;
and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.”
(John x. 31, 32.)</p>

<p>“Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more;
but ye behold me; because I live ye shall live also.” (John
xiv. 19, 20.)</p>

<p>“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; not
as the world giveth I give unto you. Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be fearful.”</p>

<p>“Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto
you. If ye loved me ye would have rejoiced, because I go
unto the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now
I have told you before it come to pass, that when it is come
to pass ye may believe.” (John xiv. 27 to 31.)</p>

<p>“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down
his life for his friends. Ye are my friends if ye do the things
which I command you.” (John xv. 13, 14.)</p>

<p>“But now I go unto him that sent me, and none of you
asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I have spoken
these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart.” (John
xv. 5, 6.)</p>

<p>“A little while and ye behold me no more, and again
a little while and ye shall see me.” (John xv. 16.)</p>

<p>“Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and
lament, but the world shall rejoice; ye shall be sorrowful,
but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.” (John xvi. 20.)</p>

<p>“And I am no more in the world, but these are in the
world, and I come to thee.” (John xvii. 11.)</p>

<p>“Again the high priest asked him and saith unto him, Art
thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I
am, and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” (Mark xiv.
62.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>To Pilate he said, “I am a king”; and “Thou wouldst
have no power against me, except it were given thee from
above.” (John xviii. 33 to 37; xix. 11.)</p>

<p>To the penitent thief he said, “Verily, I say unto thee, to-day
shalt thou be with me in paradise.” (Luke xxiii. 43.)</p>

<p>When he had cried with a loud voice <span class="smcap">he said, “Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit.”</span> (Luke xxiii. 46.)
And all the Evangelists, four witnesses, say that he “gave
up,” or “yielded up,” the ghost.</p>

<p>There is as much evidence of these utterances (and they
are not <i>all</i> of his predictions, in some form, of his death and
resurrection), as there is of any of his sayings upon any subject,
and they are so interwoven with the entire narrative that
is impossible to set them aside, and leave anything to which we
can safely assent as historically true of all his recorded acts
and words. There is no alternative, except to believe that
he uttered these predictions, or else to arbitrarily set aside
the testimony of the four Evangelists, as well as that of Paul.
It is impossible to save their character as honest witnesses,
and deny that Jesus at various times, and in different ways,
foretold his death and the circumstances attending it, and
also his resurrection, and that after he was raised from the
dead, he would go before them into Galilee. Not that we
have the <i>precise</i> words, neither more nor less, that he uttered.
In no instance do any two of the five witnesses give <i>precisely</i>
the same words. Their testimony is in accordance with
what usually<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> occurs, with honest witnesses. The witness
says, “I cannot give the exact words, or all of them.” He
is told to give the substance of what was said; and he does
so to the extent of his recollection, using some of the same
words, doubtless, but in the main expressing the idea in language
of his own. Yet there is sufficient certainty, for the
court or jury, in matters of the greatest concern. It is, in the
highest degree, unreasonable to demand more of the Evangelists.
It is also to be borne in mind that neither of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
professes to give all of our Lord’s sayings; and John, writing
much later than the others, purposely omitted many things
as having been already sufficiently stated.</p>

<p>If, then (as it cannot be doubted was a fact), Jesus plainly
foretold his death, why did it take his disciples by surprise?
The answer to this question may be that not till within six
months of the close of his ministry were they thus told;
those months were crowded with his teachings and miracles,
multitudes were following him; he had just before entered
Jerusalem as they might expect their Messiah would do, amidst
the hosannahs of thousands; and they were so filled with their
visions of his glory, and their false conceptions of the predicted
Messiah, whom they believed him to be, that they
could not understand him. Their mistake under the circumstances
was a natural one. (See also <i>post</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">c. 19</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p>Whatever difficulties may exist as to minor points, all the
facts necessary to a correct decision of the question of the
Resurrection may be ascertained with reasonable certainty,
and the order of their occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>That Jesus Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate is the
testimony of all history. That his crucifixion was the day
before the Jewish Sabbath is proved by all the Evangelists,
and the constant observance of the First Day of the week as
the Lord’s Day.</p>

<p>Having been condemned to death, and his execution entrusted
to Roman soldiers, there is the strongest presumption
that the sentence was fully executed. This presumption
is confirmed by all the Evangelists, by Paul in all his Epistles,
and by the constant teaching of all the Apostles. On the
day of Pentecost, Peter boldly said, Ye men of Israel, Jesus
of Nazareth being delivered up by the determinate counsel
and foreknowledge of God, “ye by the hand of lawless men
did crucify and slay;” and no one called in question the
fact of his death. Again, at the healing of the lame man, he
declared, “Ye denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked
for a murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince
of Life;” this charge he repeated before the Sanhedrim;
and there was no denial. When Peter and John, after their
release from prison, were brought before the Council, one
charge against them was: “Ye have filled Jerusalem with
your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
us.” Stephen, when brought before the Council, declared,
“Ye have now become the betrayers and murderers ... of
the Righteous One.” If there could have been the slightest
doubt of the actual death of Christ, the Council would have
furnished the evidence.</p>

<p>John solemnly declares that “one of the soldiers, with a
spear, pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood
and water.” It was a thrust by a Roman soldier to make the
fact of death absolutely certain. It was such a result as
would have followed, if, from excessive labors and extreme
agony, there was a collection of water about the heart, or if
from like causes, and as Dr. Stroud and other eminent surgeons
suppose,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the cause of his death was a rupture or
breaking of the heart.</p>

<p>And, finally, not less than forty times, on different occasions,
and in a variety of ways, had Jesus foretold his death.
He instituted a Sacrament to commemorate it; he said to the
penitent thief: “This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise;”
and in the extreme moment, “Father, into thy hands I
commend my Spirit.” It is not possible to accept the hypothesis
of his return to life from a state of lethargy, without
destroying <i>his</i> moral character, as well as that of his disciples.
Where was he, when Peter and Stephen were charging
home his death upon the guilty Jews? Where was he, when
Stephen suffered martyrdom for his sake, and when his apostles
and disciples were preaching his death and resurrection?</p>

<p>Even Strauss is constrained to say “The whole country-side
knew that he was dead.”</p>

<p>He was buried. So says Paul, and<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> all the Evangelists.
As the day of the crucifixion was drawing to its close, that
the bodies should not remain on the cross<a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> upon the Sabbath
(for that day<a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the Sabbath, was a high day), the Jews
asked of Pilate that the legs of those who had been crucified
might be broken,<a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and they be taken away. The soldiers
brake the legs of the others, but not of Jesus, for they found
that he was already dead; and his death was assured by one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
of the soldiers. Thereupon Joseph of Arimathea, a rich man
and a counsellor, begged the body of Jesus. Pilate, after he
knew from the centurion that he was dead, commanded it to
be delivered. Joseph, with Nicodemus, wound it in fine
linen with spices, and laid it in his own new tomb, hewn out
in the rock, rolled a great stone “to,” or “against” the door,
and departed. The sepulchre was “nigh at hand,” otherwise,
there would not have been time for the burial before the
coming in of the Sabbath. The next<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> day the chief priests
and Pharisees or some of them, obtained from Pilate a guard,
and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone (Matthew
xxvii. 62, 66).</p>

<p>The objection that they could not have known that Jesus
had said, “After three days I will rise again,” is well answered
by Alford: “Not the saying, but its meaning was hid from
his disciples.” Judas knew it, and may have informed the
chief priests and Pharisees of it; and they may have known
it from other sources, for it was not spoken in secret. Nor
with their perverse rejection of him while they could not
deny his works, is it improbable that they might have some
apprehension of the necessity of a guard? We are not to
judge them from our standpoint, but from theirs. They did
<i>not</i> believe that he was the Messiah (Acts iii. 17; 1 Corinthians
ii. 8). They said and doubtless believed, after a fashion,
“He deceiveth the people” and “casteth out devils
through the prince of the devils.” Their guilty fears were
the occasion of this increased certainty of his resurrection.
The mention of a guard by Matthew (although not by the
other Evangelists), is in perfect keeping with his previous
occupation, which had led him to make, and observe, precautions
against fraud. It was, in his view, as in ours, an important
fact that their precautions against imposition had reacted
upon themselves. His narrative is unimpeached. It
was published early, and his statement of the appointment of
a guard was not contradicted.</p>

<p>The facts must stand that Jesus died, and was buried; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
at the instance of his bitterest foes, soldiers guarded his
tomb against the little company of his frightened followers.</p>

<p>At a very early hour on the first day of the week it was
known that the stone had been rolled away, and the body of
Jesus was not in the tomb. Such is the testimony of all the
Evangelists. This great fact is at the threshold of our inquiry.
It must be accounted for. The Christian’s explanation is that
Jesus rose from the dead, and an angel of the Lord descended
and rolled away the stone. The account which the soldiers
were induced to circulate was, that his disciples came by night
and stole him away while they slept. This story was current
among the Jews when Matthew wrote<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> his Gospel, and when,
nearly a hundred years after, Justin Martyr wrote to Trypho
the Jew. It ought not to be difficult to determine which explanation
is the true one.</p>

<p>As soon as Mary Magdalene (who was of the company of
women who came first to see the sepulchre), saw that the
stone was rolled away, she ran to Peter and John, saying,
“They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb and we know
not where they have laid him.” (John xx. 2.)</p>

<p>The other women<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> entered into the sepulchre, and found
not the body of Jesus, but saw two angels, one of whom said
to them, “He is not here, he is risen; but go your way and
tell his disciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into
Galilee, there shall ye see him as he said unto you.” (Why
should the Apostles be told that Jesus would go before them
into Galilee, if he was to show himself to them that very day
at Jerusalem? Both to prepare them for the interview at
Jerusalem, and in order that the tidings might be carried to
all the disciples, the most of whom were in Galilee.)</p>

<p>They departed quickly with fear and great joy, and told
these things unto such of the Apostles as they found in the
city; but “these words appeared in their sight as idle talk;
and they disbelieved them.” (Luke xxiv. 11.)</p>

<p>As soon as Peter and John knew from Mary Magdalene, of
the open sepulchre, they ran both together, but John outran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Peter and came first to the tomb; “and stooping and looking
in, he seeth the linen clothes lying; yet entered he not in.
Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and enters
into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen clothes lying and
the napkin that was upon his head, not lying with the linen
clothes, but rolled up in a place by itself. Then entered in
therefore the other disciple also, which came first to the tomb,
and he saw and believed. For as yet they knew not the
Scripture that he must rise again from the dead. So the disciples
went away again unto their own home.” (John xx.
1-10.)</p>

<p>Such is the circumstantial account given by John of the
state of things at the tomb, as they found it before Jesus
appeared to any one, and before they had received any information
that he had risen from the dead. The body was not
there. It could hardly have been removed by friends, and
they both be ignorant of it. Had it been taken by enemies?
There were the linen clothes, and there, rolled up in a place
by itself, was the napkin. Who had arranged them thus?
“All had been done calmly, collectedly. Neither earthly
friends nor earthly foes had done it; the one would not have
stripped the garments from the body, the other would have
been at no pains so carefully to arrange<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and deposit them.”
So John must have reasoned and, perhaps recalling what Jesus
had said, he <i>believed</i>. He believed from what he <i>saw</i>, and
not from the Scriptures, for as yet he knew not from them,
that the Christ “must rise again from the dead.” It is not
probable that he then avowed his conviction. He trusted that
Jesus would, in due time, reveal himself to them all.</p>

<p>The particulars of his appearance to Mary Magdalene
appear in the Fourth Gospel. She was not expecting to see
him, and, blinded by her tears, she knew not that it was Jesus
until he spoke her name, doubtless in a familiar tone. She
turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, <i>Rabboni</i>,
which is to say, Master. She <i>would</i> have clung to him.
Jesus had told his disciples before his crucifixion that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
to go to the Father. But this event was yet in the future;
and when she would detain him, Jesus saith to her, Touch me
not (or Take not hold on me) for I am not yet ascended unto
the Father: but go unto my brethren and say to them, I
ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and my God, and
your God. This would remind <i>them</i> of what he had told them;
and would remind <i>her</i>, as Peter afterwards was reminded, that
she would best manifest her love by willing service. She
obeyed. But those to whom she told it, when they heard that
he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved. (Mark
xvi. 17.)</p>

<p>The other women after delivering the message of the angels,
returned. And behold Jesus met them saying “All Hail.”
And they came and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.
Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren
that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
(Matthew xxviii. 9, 10.) Matthew, speaking in a general way,
does not distinguish this appearance from that to Mary Magdalene,
but blends the two together. The salutation was
different, and the message and the circumstances were different.
Nor is it, as Strauss (p. 813) vainly imagines, any
objection to the hypothesis of separate appearances, that it
involves “a restless running to and fro of the disciples and
the women;” for under the intense excitement it could hardly
have been otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Jesus joined himself to two of the disciples on their journey
to Emmaus, discoursed to them by the way, and made himself
known in the breaking of bread. One of them was
Cleopas, the other (his name not given) is supposed<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to have
been Luke. When they left Jerusalem, the woman had
reported the message from the angel. Peter and John had
returned from the tomb, but no one had seen the Risen Lord.
The time of their leaving was before Mary Magdalene had
told that she had seen the Lord. The day therefore must
have been considerably advanced before Jesus appeared to
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>It was toward evening, when Jesus sat down with them to
meat. Their eyes were opened and they knew him, and he
“vanished out of their sight.”</p>

<p>And they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem,
and found the eleven gathered together and them that were
with them, saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and hath
appeared to Simon.”</p>

<p>This, as we learn from Paul, was the first appearance to
any of the Apostles. The time and place are not mentioned.
We only know that it was before the arrival of the two
disciples. Emmaus<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was about eight miles from Jerusalem.
The narrative seems to indicate that the event had but just
occurred.</p>

<p>The two disciples rehearsed the things that had happened.
As they spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of the disciples,
and said, “Peace be unto you.” But they were terrified
and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. He
said unto them, “Why are ye troubled, and wherefore do
reasonings arise in your heart? See my hands and my feet,
that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.” And when he
had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet; and
while they still disbelieved for joy and wondered, he said unto
them, “Have ye here anything to eat?” and they gave him
a piece of broiled fish. And he took it, and did eat before
them. (Luke xxiv. 35-43.)</p>

<p>But Thomas, who was not with them, having said, “Except
I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my
finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his
side, I will not believe,” Jesus eight days after stood in their
midst and said, “Peace be unto you.” Then saith he to
Thomas, “Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and
reach hither thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not
faithless, but believing.” Thomas answered and said unto
him, “My Lord and my God.” Jesus saith unto him,
“Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed; blessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
are they that have not seen and yet have believed.” (John
xx. 24-29.)</p>

<p>After these things Jesus manifested himself at the Sea of
Tiberias, to Peter, Thomas, Nathaniel, James, John and two
others. It was on this occasion that he three times asked
Simon Peter, “Lovest thou me?” and he signified to him
by what death he should glorify God. This is said to
be the <i>third</i> time that he manifested himself to the disciples,
<i>i. e.</i>, to the Apostles when they were together. (John
xxi. 1-23.)</p>

<p>Then he appeared (says Paul) to above five hundred
brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now,
but some are fallen asleep. Paul is speaking only of manifestations
to Apostles or some of them. The Apostles surely
were not absent from this great assembly. All the circumstances
indicate that it was the meeting which he had provided<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
for, before his crucifixion, and that it occurred on a
mountain in Galilee.</p>

<p>Then he appeared to James. Paul is our authority. Neither
time, nor place, nor circumstance is given. It is strong
confirmation of the genuineness of our writings that there is
no disclosure of the particulars of the interview with either
Peter, the first of the Apostles, or with James, our Lord’s
brother. Jesus doubtless had something to say to each for
himself alone, and none of the sacred writers have lifted the
veil.</p>

<p>At the end of the forty days he led the Apostles out over
against Bethany, gave them his final charge, and lifted up his
hands and blessed them. And it came to pass while he
blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into
heaven. (Luke xxiv. 50-53; Acts i. 1-12.)</p>

<p>Such are some of the proofs of his resurrection. Their
sufficiency as evidence of it, and its logical results, remain to
be considered.</p>

<span class="smaller">SUFFICIENCY OF THE PROOFS (FALSE ASSUMPTIONS).</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Evidence which ought to convince a reasonable man should
be deemed sufficient.</p>

<p>The standing objection from the days of Celsus, that
Jesus should have shown himself after his resurrection to
his enemies, is unreasonable. It is as if one should refuse
to believe the transfiguration, the raising of the daughter of
Jairus, or the agony in the garden, because not witnessed by
the multitude, and by only Peter, James, and John of the
Apostles.</p>

<p>His humiliation and sufferings were ended. Not again was
he to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified. Those who
had wilfully rejected him, would have been no more convinced
than before. They had said he cast out devils through
the prince of devils. They had plotted to put Lazarus also to
death, whom he had raised up before their eyes. They had
bribed the soldiers to report that his body had been stolen.
They would have proclaimed that he was not dead, or else
that his return to life was by the agency of Satan. To return
to those who had put every insult upon him, and were ready
to renew the attack, could only have been to their swift
destruction, and the time for this had not come.</p>

<p>And even if some of them had believed, it would have
added nothing to the proof. Any one who now refuses to
accept the genuineness of the Gospel, or the credibility of the
writers, or, accepting both, refuses to believe upon the testimony
of his disciples, would not be convinced by any amount
of evidence. There would remain every question of credibility,
and, in addition, that of personal identity, as to which
only those intimately acquainted with him were fully qualified
to judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>The proofs will be found sufficient by those who are disposed
to lay aside preconceived adverse opinions, and believe
the fact when it is proved.</p>

<h3>PROOF IS POSSIBLE.</h3>

<p>The event <i>may</i> have occurred. By this is meant that it
cannot be said that its occurrence is, in the nature of things,
an impossibility.</p>

<p>The existence of the Lord God Almighty, the Jehovah of
the Scriptures, may be real, as accepted by the reason and
conscience of most men in civilized nations. It may have
been within his power to raise his Son, Jesus Christ, from
the dead; and there may have been sufficient reasons for the
exercise of this power. He may have been able to do this,
without violating, or suspending, any law of his universe.
The resurrection may have been as conformable to law as the
death of the body. The law of gravitation is neither violated
nor suspended, but merely overcome, in numberless instances
every day, by the introduction of what is, under the circumstances,
a greater force; and it may be a universal <i>law</i> that
the greater force (other things being equal) shall overcome
the less. If it were true that the like had never occurred, it
cannot be maintained that God has not in any instance done
something which he had not done before, and of which consequently
there had been no previous experience. “Men,”
says Dr. Taylor,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “are continually reaching results which the
forces of nature, left to themselves, never could have caused;
and if this be so with men, why should we deny to God the
possibility of intervening in a similar way, and so producing
effects that are not merely supernatural, but superhuman?”
And why, we ask, should we deny to him the possibility of
doing something which he has not done before; “My Father
<i>worketh</i> hitherto,” said Jesus, “and I work.”</p>

<p>“The<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> affirmation of the impossibility of a miracle carries
with it the elimination of God out of the universe.” There is
no escape from this conclusion; and consequently there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
those who admit the possibility<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of miracles, even while denying
that they can be proved.</p>

<p>The event, then, <i>may</i> have occurred. <i>It is a question of
evidence</i>.</p>

<p>Again, if Christ did rise from the dead, he would give his
disciples sufficient evidence of it. He could give to the bodily
senses and perceptive powers which they had as other men
have (and which “experience” tells us, may be trusted when
they have a fair chance), such proofs of his resurrection that
they could believe it, and rationally believe it. This may be
said to be almost a truism. To concede that God could, and
did, raise Jesus Christ from the dead, and deny that he could,
or would, afford evidence of it, if not an utter absurdity, is in
the highest degree unreasonable, and we are not trying to
convince any but reasonable men. To what end should he
perform this miracle, and yet afford no evidence of it? The
question right here is not whether <i>we</i> have sufficient evidence
for our assurance, but whether his <i>disciples</i> could reasonably
be convinced of his resurrection, assuming that it really took
place.</p>

<p>Then if <i>they</i> might rationally believe what actually occurred,
upon evidence furnished <i>them</i>, those to whom they declared
it, and we to whom their testimony has come, may <i>also</i>
believe it. If they were not bound to reject the evidence
of their own senses, because of previous experience or the
want of it, neither were those to whom they preached, nor we
ourselves, bound to reject it.</p>

<p>In other words, assuming that Christ did rise from the
dead, and assuming that satisfactory proofs of his resurrection
were given to his disciples, it is not <i>impossible</i> that sufficient
evidence of both of these facts may be accessible to us. To
deny this, is to say that Christ must die and rise again, in
every age, and in every place, where there are nations or
persons, whether few or many, who have not before witnessed
such events. Yet to this absurdity must Hume’s famous
argument from experience come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>If Jesus rose from the dead, the fact was susceptible of
proof to his disciples. It was susceptible of proof to those
who believed it on the testimony of his disciples. It is susceptible
of proof to one to whom that testimony is transmitted.
Assuming his resurrection to be true, it would be
more wonderful than a miracle, if all means of a rational
belief in the fact were the exclusive property of his immediate
disciples; and their contemporaries and all after them,
to the end of time, be compelled in the exercise of right
reason to reject it, notwithstanding it is true. Hence we say
as the basis of further argument that the resurrection <i>may</i>
have occurred; and if it did occur, we undoubtedly have such
evidence of it as may be accepted by a reasonable man.
Leaving, then, the possible for the probable, in a matter that
is but a question of evidence.</p>

<h3>WHAT ARE THE PROOFS?</h3>

<p>The fact of Christ’s resurrection was proclaimed by his
Apostles and disciples from the beginning of their ministry,
commencing on the Day of Pentecost, fifty days after the
crucifixion. This fact was, as expressed by Paul, that Christ
“died,” and was “buried,” and was “raised on the third
day;” and by Luke that “he showed himself alive after his
passion, by many proofs,” appearing unto the Apostles whom
he had chosen<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, for forty days, “and speaking the things
concerning the kingdom of God;” and by Peter, “whom
God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death because it
was not possible that he should be holden of it:” and “Ye
killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised from the dead;
whereof we are witnesses.”</p>

<p>The evidence being conclusive that such was the proclamation,
how is it to be accounted for? The obvious explanation
is, that the Apostles so preached because they so believed,
and because such was the fact, and they had sufficient evidence
of it: and this has been accepted by the church these
eighteen hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>How do infidels account for the preaching of the Resurrection
within fifty days after the crucifixion? <i>Some</i> have claimed
that his death was not real, and that he recovered from a
swoon. This is disproved by the evidence to which we have
referred<a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and, although once held by Paulus and others, has
by later skeptical writers been “treated with contempt.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
“The whole country-side,” says Strauss,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “knew that he was
dead.” Roman executioners made sure work. Pilate refused
his consent to any removal until he had instituted an inquiry,
and knew that Jesus was dead; nor is it possible to accept
the hypothesis of a return from mere lethargy or trance,
without destroying his moral character. This hypothesis may
be put aside.</p>

<p><i>Others</i> have claimed that the Apostles did not believe what
they preached. To accept this view we must conclude that,
without motive and against every motive, and “amidst sufferings
the most grievous to flesh and blood, they persevered
in a conspiracy to cheat the world into piety, honesty and
benevolence.” Conscience and common sense revolt against
such a theory, and it shares the fate of the other. It has,
says Professor Milligan,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “been abandoned by every inquirer
to whom a moment’s attention is due.”</p>

<p>The <i>final</i> refuge of most infidel writers, is the theory of
visions. By this they mean that the appearances of our Lord
were either optical illusions, or mere hallucinations.</p>

<p>Some, like Dr. Hooykaas<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in Holland, and Judge Waite<a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
in this country, claim that the doctrine preached was <i>not</i>
that Christ’s <i>body</i> was raised up, but that his <i>spirit</i> came back
from Hades, or the place of departed spirits. We have before<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
shown that such a conception is an entire perversion of
the language of Paul, as well as of the Evangelists. And Mr.
Hooykaas’ argument that we are never told that Jesus rose
“from death,” far less “from the grave,” but always “from
the dead,” does not agree with the record; and if it did, the
inference would be unwarrantable. When the angel said to
the woman, “Why seek ye the living among the dead? he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
not here but is risen,” they were not looking for him in
Hades! Peter, in the passage from which we have quoted,
distinguishes between Hades and the grave, for he says, that
David, “foreseeing, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that
neither was his soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
This Jesus did God raise up.”</p>

<p>Now, by what evidence is the theory of visions or optical
illusions to be tested? By the <i>whole</i> evidence? By suppressing
a part, and changing the rest? Judicial fairness
requires that the whole be considered, just as it comes to us,
reconciling such parts as may be reconciled, and adopting the
more probable view in case of any seeming contradictions, if
there <i>are</i> any. Yet those who deny the resurrection adopt a
course that could not be tolerated in any judge or jury, or
secular historian. They <i>suppress</i>, or <i>supply</i>, as best suits
their theory.</p>

<p>Thus some of them assume that there were no appearances
at Jerusalem, although the contrary is plain in all the Evangelists.
Even Mark, whom Strauss treats as giving the oldest
tradition, represents the women as going to the sepulchre.
This implies that they were at Jerusalem, if the sepulchre
was at Jerusalem. Were they there alone? Mark, in saying
that “the disciples left Jesus when he was arrested, and fled,”
does <i>not</i> say that they fled from Jerusalem. On the contrary,
he, in the same chapter, speaks of Peter as following Jesus
afar off, and then denying him. And so in the Fourth Gospel,
“the disciple whom Jesus loved” is said to have been so
near to the cross, that Jesus could say unto him “Behold thy
mother!” They would not leave Jerusalem till the end of
the Feast. This continued one week, the first day and the
last being “an holy convocation.” Although they fled at
first, they rallied; and they did not leave Jerusalem till they
had conformed to the requirements of the law. Mark also, in
giving the direction, “Go tell his disciples and Peter,” “He
goeth <i>before</i> you into Galilee,” implies that they had not yet
gone into Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>They also assume that the Apostles believed because of
Mary Magdalene’s faith. <i>This is pure fiction.</i> Peter and
John knew that the tomb was empty, before the appearance
to Mary Magdalene. Matthew does not mention her statement
that she had seen the Lord, nor John the reception
which she had. Mark<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> says that they, when they heard that
he was alive, and had been seen of her, “disbelieved;” and
Luke<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (referring to all the women) says that their words
“appeared in their sight as idle talk, and they disbelieved
them.” There is not the slightest allusion to Mary Magdalene,
or to the company of women, in the Acts of the Apostles,
or either of the Epistles. How idle, then, is Renan’s boast,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
that “the glory of the Resurrection belongs to Mary of Magdala.”
Indeed it might appear to us that there should have
been some reference to her. The explanation, probably, is
twofold: Among the Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> women were not competent
witnesses; and Paul and the Apostles rested their faith upon
appearances to Apostles, either alone or in company with
others, they being the constituted witnesses. When one was to
be substituted for Judas, Peter<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> said that the choice must be
made from those “which have companied with us all the time
that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning
from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received
up from us; of these must one become a witness with us of
his resurrection.” And Paul makes no reference to the
journey to Emmaus.</p>

<p>They also assume that the Apostles were in a state of
mind conducive to misleading fancies. The reverse of this
is true. It must, however, be conceded that the idea of a
restoration to life of one who had been dead was not strange
to them; for three<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> such instances were recorded in their
Scriptures, and they had witnessed three miracles of the kind.
But these were in respect to persons who, after they were
raised up, lived and died as other men; and they were
brought to life by some visible agency, as by a prophet in the
name of the Lord, or Jesus by his own word. The resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
which the disciples came to believe was, on the contrary,
to a temporary sojourning with them, and then an ascension
before their eyes; and it was accomplished by no visible
hand.</p>

<p>And although Jesus had predicted his death and resurrection,
they could not understand the one, any more than the
other, because they could not conceive how that their Messiah
could suffer death at the hands of his enemies. The evidence
upon this point is most conclusive; and its scope was
admirably put by Gilbert West,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> four generations ago. “This,
therefore, being their settled notion of the Messiah, can we
wonder their former faith in him should be extinguished,
when they saw him suffering, crucified, and dying, and, instead
of saving others, not able to save himself? To prepare
them for these events he had indeed most circumstantially
foretold<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> his own sufferings, death, and resurrection;
but the Apostles themselves assure us that they did
not understand those predictions till some time after their
accomplishment; and they made this confession at a time
when they were as sensible of their former dullness, and
undoubtedly as much amazed at it as they now pretend to be
who object to it against them; so that their veracity upon
this point is not to be questioned.... They had conceived
great expectations from the persuasion that he was the Christ
of God; but these were all vanished; their promised deliverer,
their expected king, was dead and buried, and no one
left to call him from the grave as he did Lazarus. With
his life, they might presume, ended his power of working
miracles; and death, perhaps, was an enemy he could not
subdue, since it was apparent he could not escape it, and
hence their despair.”</p>

<p>And hence we say, when the third day was ushered in
there was no one of all his disciples at the sepulchre to welcome
him. Those who loved him most, came but to embalm
his body. Mary Magdalene beheld <i>not</i> her risen Saviour,
but an empty tomb; and her hurried tidings were <i>not</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
he is risen, but, “They have taken away the Lord out of the
tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.” When
Jesus even speaks to her, she at first supposes him to be the
gardener, and says, “If thou hast borne him hence, tell me
where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.” Peter
and John beheld no vision, but only “the linen clothes lying,
and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the
linen clothes, but rolled up in a place by itself.” The other
women do not see Jesus until after they have found that the
sepulchre is empty, and have been told by the angels, “He
is risen, even as he said: <span class="smcap">Come see the place where<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the
Lord lay</span>.” The two disciples, some hours after, had heard,
not that he had been <i>seen</i>, but that certain women who were
early at the tomb found not his body, and were told by
angels that he was alive; and that the absence of the body
had been confirmed by those of their company who visited the
tomb. And finally, the Apostles, instead of <i>expecting</i> to see
him, refused to believe upon the testimony of the women, and
were only convinced by the evidence of their own senses.</p>

<p>“What I insist on is, that a miracle cannot be established by human testimony.”—Ingersoll,
<i>North American Review</i> for November, 1881, p. 514.
The skeptical author of <i>Supernatural Religion</i> in defending himself
against the criticism that upon his theory his historical argument is unnecessary,
in his preface to the sixth edition, says: “The preliminary
affirmation is not that miracles are impossible, but that they are antecedently
incredible. The counter allegation is that although miracles may
be antecedently incredible, they nevertheless actually took place. It is,
therefore, necessary, not only to establish the antecedent incredibility,
but to examine the validity of the allegation that certain miracles occurred,
and this involves the historical inquiry into the evidence for the Gospels.
Indeed many will not acknowledge the case to be complete until other
witnesses are questioned. This would leave the question of Christ’s Resurrection
to be determined as a matter of evidence; and of course evidence
enough to induce a reasonable conviction would be sufficient to overcome
the antecedent improbability.” But he dare not trust himself or his readers
to an examination of the evidence upon this basis. For when he is
pressed with the testimony of the Apostles to the Resurrection, and is
compelled to concede their honesty, he says (p. 1050), “The belief
that a dead man rose from the dead and appeared to several persons alive
is at once disposed of upon abstract grounds.” That is, his pretended examination
of the evidence is a sham, and when he cannot meet it, it is at
once disposed of “upon abstract grounds!”</p>

</div>

<p>Holding, then, the objectors to the historical record, and
keeping in mind that the question is narrowed down to the
hypothesis of visions on the one hand, or to a true resurrection
on the other, <i>what evidence had the Apostles and immediate
disciples that they were not deceived</i>?</p>

<p>First and foremost, they had the empty tomb. They knew<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that the body was neither left on the cross, in violation of the
Jewish law, nor thrown to the “dust-heap,” in violation of
the Roman law which required a delivery to the friends as
soon as claimed, but was placed in the sepulchre, as attested
by all the Evangelists, as also by Paul. They knew that <i>they</i>
had not taken it away, and that if the Jews had, they would
have been but too ready to produce it when, only a few days
after, it was boldly proclaimed, that that Jesus whom they had
crucified, God had raised from the dead. It was the absence
of the body that first arrested the attention of the women,
and also of Peter and John, and which, with the orderly
arrangement of the grave clothes, induced a conviction of the
truth in the mind of John, before Jesus appeared to any, and
sent Peter to his home “wondering.” And these same facts
(the good faith of the disciples themselves being undoubted),
can never be explained, in any rational way, otherwise than
by the fact of the Resurrection. There is a great truth in
Professor Keim’s expression<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that: “It is upon an empty tomb
that the Christian Church is founded.”</p>

<p>They had <i>further</i> proof, in subsequent appearances to individuals
singly, to the collective body of Apostles, and to the
multitude of believers, under circumstances that satisfied
them, and should convince us, that they were not deceived.</p>

<p>There are several things to be considered, in determining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
whether they were deceived. First, in respect to time. There
were no appearances till after the fact that the tomb was
empty was fully understood, <i>nor till some hours after</i>. This
lapse of time has been overlooked by most writers; and, from
want of attention to it, inconsistencies as to occurrences at
the sepulchre, as to the number and appearance of angels,
the companies of women, the persons composing them, the
messages received and carried, and the appearances to them,
of our risen Lord, have been imagined, that are easily explained,
upon the very natural hypothesis of several transactions
of like character during the six hours or more<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which
elapsed before the journey to Emmaus. At that time no one
had seen the Lord; for it cannot be doubted that his appearance
would be reported as soon as possible after its occurrence.
When Jesus joined the two disciples, their eyes were
“holden,” until in a long discourse he had prepared them for a
revelation of himself. Peter must have meditated some hours
upon the absence of the body, before Jesus showed himself to
him. It was not till after this, and after the return of the
disciples from Emmaus, that he said to the others, “Peace be
unto you.” Then a whole week, before he returns. Then,
probably after a longer interval (for they returned to Galilee),
he shows himself at the Sea of Tiberias. Then, after some
days, to above five hundred brethren, at a place to which they
had been directed to go by the angels, and by Jesus both
before and after his resurrection. Then to James. And then
at Jerusalem to the Apostles, whom he led out over against
Bethany; and while he blessed them, he parted from them
and was carried up into heaven.</p>

<p>In all this, we see how they were prepared to exercise a
sober and intelligent judgment, so that neither they, nor we,
should be in doubt whether what they beheld was their risen
Lord, or a phantom of their own imagination.</p>

<p>And will any one tell us, right here, what better proof Jesus
<i>could</i> have given his disciples, of his Resurrection? If the
evidence was sufficient for them, it may be sufficient for us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
unless we are prepared to say that the miracle shall <i>be repeated
whenever it is challenged</i>! Was it essential to a reasonable
conviction on their part that the Scribes and Pharisees should
also be convinced? (Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimathea,
<i>were</i> convinced.) It must be admitted that the disciples, of
all others, were qualified to judge, if any persons could be
qualified. What force could the belief of the Sanhedrim have
added to the testimony of their own senses?</p>

<p>Assume, as a hypothesis, the reality of Christ’s resurrection,
we again ask, What proof of it <i>should</i> have been given his
disciples that was not given? They had the same kind of
proof, during forty days, that they had before his crucifixion.
He walked with them, talked with them, instructed them, ate
before them, and with them (Acts. x. 41), called things to
their remembrance, opened to them the Scriptures, and gave
them their great commission to disciple all nations; and, to
preclude all questioning, said, “See my hands and my feet,
that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye behold me have. And when he had
said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.” And to
Thomas, eight days after, he said, “Reach hither thy finger
and see my hands; and reach thy hand and put it into my side:
and be not faithless but believing.”</p>

<p>We do not accept Origen’s<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> view that Jesus after his resurrection
and before his ascension “existed in a body intermediate,
as it were, between the grossness of that which he had
before his suffering and the appearance of a soul uncovered by
such a body,” although it now has the support of able writers.
The general<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> sentiment of the Church from the beginning has
been against it. It is not warranted by the record, and it
involves more mysteries and difficulties than it escapes. We
fully agree with Judge Waite<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that, according to the Canonical
Gospels, “The very body in which Jesus was crucified, and
which was buried by Joseph of Arimathea, is raised from the
dead, appears to the disciples, is not only seen but felt, and
Jesus himself, in the flesh, as he was before he was crucified,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
calls for fish to eat to satisfy his disciples that he was not a
spirit; that his body was not spiritual, but material and human
like theirs;” and also with a very different man (Mr. Barnes),
who, with his usual good sense, says: “It was necessary <i>first</i>
to establish the proof of his resurrection, and that could be
done <i>only</i> by his appearing <i>as he was</i> when he died;” and also
with Drs. McClintock and Strong in their invaluable Cyclopedia,
that: “According to the Scriptures the disciples were
assured by the testimony of their own senses that the body of
Christ after his resurrection was the same identical body of
human flesh and bones which had been crucified and laid
in the sepulchre.” (Vol. VIII., A.D. 1879.) Peter’s testimony
(as recorded in Acts x. 41) that Jesus after he was
raised up was made manifest, not to all the people, but unto
witnesses that were chosen before of God, even to us “who
did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead,” seems
just as decisive as the Canonical Gospels. And so of John’s
testimony (1 John i. 1), “that which we beheld, and our hands
handled.”</p>

<p>Our Lord was in the tomb less than thirty-six hours, and
his flesh “did not see corruption.” His body, apparently, was
as human as that of Lazarus after he was raised. The criticism
that it is not said that there was <i>blood</i> seems frivolous,
for there could be no living flesh or bones without blood-vessels
and blood. Although for the time he forbade Mary Magdalene
to touch, or rather to detain him, he permitted the
other women to take hold of his feet, and directed the Apostles
to handle him. Mary Magdalene saw him as a man, and
supposed him to be the gardener, until he called her by name.
The two disciples conversed with him as a man; and that
they did not know him was only because their eyes were
“holden.” His sudden disappearance after the repast, and
equally sudden appearance in the midst of the Apostles, at
most present no greater difficulties than his transfiguration,
his walking upon the sea, his passing through his enemies
when they were about to throw him down the cliff (all before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
his crucifixion), or the opening of the prison doors to two of
the Apostles. The doors, even if bolted and barred, may
have opened as to Peter, or those present may have been so
preoccupied that a perfectly natural but silent withdrawal in
the one case, and entrance in the other, were simply unnoticed.</p>

<p>As the man Christ Jesus, he rose from the dead, and
angels, as porters, having rolled away the stone, he came
forth in visible human form, and with the same body that was
crucified. He would have been seen by his disciples, if they
had been “watching and waiting” for him, and by the guard,
if they had not become “as dead men;” perhaps in order
that they might not behold him, for he had said, “Yet a
little while and the world beholdeth me no more.” (John
xiv. 19.)</p>

<p>As the man Christ Jesus, he showed himself to his disciples
forty days; and then, with a body, until then, of
flesh and blood, as human as that of Elijah, before <i>he</i> was
taken up, ascended into the heavens.</p>

<p>Thus, in his rising from the dead, and in the change <i>at his
ascension</i>, he typified both the dead who shall be raised, and
the living who shall be “changed.”</p>

<p>And any conception of him as less corporeal from his resurrection
to his ascension than before, does not conform to
the record, and, by so much as it makes him less corporeal
and tangible, it impairs the force of the evidence.</p>

<p>Each one of the Apostles had as much evidence that Jesus
was alive after his crucifixion, as he had that Peter or John
or Thomas was alive, and evidence of just as high a character.
And this proof by facts addressed to their own intelligence
and bodily senses of sight, and hearing, and feeling, was continued
forty days. There is no conflict in the evidence on
this point.</p>

<p>Every lawyer knows that omission is not contradiction.
Even when witnesses profess to give the whole, it rarely or
never happens that some will not state something which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
others omit, and not unfrequently a witness is called to testify
to a part only, and does not undertake to give the whole.</p>

<p>This is the precise truth in respect to the Evangelists.
Not one of them professes to state all that occurred after the
crucifixion, or all the instances of our Lord’s appearing to
his disciples. Each writes for the particular object he has
in view. And there is a great liability to mistake, if one forgets
that it is true in narratives in respect to transactions
subsequent to the crucifixion, as well as before, that there is
often a passing from one event to another with nothing to indicate
but that they were immediately connected in point of
time, when, in fact, there was a considerable interval between
them.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Of the ten specified instances of his appearing, Matthew
speaks of two, Mark of three, Luke of three, John of
four, and Paul of five, or seven;<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but neither contradicts the
other, nor Luke’s statement in his subsequent “treatise,”
that Jesus showed himself alive after his passion “forty
days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of
God.”</p>

<p>The instances were sufficiently numerous, the time long
enough, and the acts tangible enough, to afford as undoubted
proof as that which they had of the existence and bodily
presence of each other. Peter might as well have doubted
the denial of which he had so bitterly repented, as to have
doubted that it was his Master who said unto him the third
time, “Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?” and all of them
might as well have doubted that they had ever listened to
his teaching, as to have doubted the commission which they
received from him.</p>

<p>The evidence that was personal to themselves we cannot
have. We know they had it, and were capable of judging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
concerning it, and we can see that it was of a character that
might be justly deemed conclusive.</p>

<p>There is, besides, much that is common to us with them.
The judgment was not of one but of many, and not from a
single appearance to one of their number, but from many
appearances to different persons, at various times, and under
circumstances most favorable to a true apprehension, usually
in open day; and it would be passing strange if each and all
were deceived by their own senses.</p>

<p>These appearances were never repeated after the ascension.
None of the disciples under any excitement ever again
saw their Lord as the man Christ Jesus walking the earth as
before; or saw him coming to the earth, although they all
believed that he would speedily return in like manner as they
beheld him going into heaven. Stephen saw him not upon the
earth, but “standing on the right hand of God.” Paul saw
him, and “was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision”
(Acts xxvi. 19). John saw him, in vision, not only as “the
Son of Man” in glorious array, but as “the Lion of the tribe
of Judah,” and also as a “Lamb standing as though it had
been slain,” in the “midst of the throne” (Revelation i.
12-20, and v. 5-8).</p>

<p>Their subsequent experience is consistent, if they had
been dealing with realities. But if all their interviews
during those forty days were a delusion, and the ascension
a delusion, it is wholly inexplicable that their imagination
or senses never played them false afterward. They
believed that he would soon return, just as strongly as
they believed that he had ascended, and yet they never saw
him returning, or as having returned.</p>

<p>If delusions created the faith, how much more should the
faith multiply the delusions, and such appearances (as Godet<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
has well put it) “go on increasing as the square of the belief
itself.” Yet at the very time when they should have multiplied,
if they were <i>not</i> real, they ceased altogether!</p>

<p>We have, as the disciples had, our Lord’s predictions<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
death <i>and</i> resurrection (for the two events were generally
referred to in the same discourse), and the prophecies concerning
him.</p>

<p>The greatest obstacle to their acceptance of his resurrection
was their inability to comprehend his death if he were
indeed the true Messiah. And hence we find that Jesus
in the walk to Emmaus, opens to the disciples the Scriptures
concerning himself, and says, “Behoved it not the Christ to
suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?” We may
well suppose that with other prophecies, he interpreted to
them what Daniel had said (c. ix. 26) that “after three score
and two weeks, shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself;”
and that wonderful chapter in Isaiah (the fifty-third) so descriptive
of his passion, that it seems “as if written at the
foot of the cross;” and all the sacrifices for fifteen hundred
years; and that it was not possible “that the blood of bulls
and goats should take away sins;” and as Moses lifted up
the serpent in the wilderness, even so was the Son of Man
“lifted up.” And so to the Apostles he explained the Scriptures,
and said to them, “Thus it is written that the Christ
should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day.”
(Luke xxiv. 45, 46). He reminds them what he had said,
that all things must needs be fulfilled which were written in
the law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms concerning
himself (Luke xxiv. 44). The angels say to the
women, “Tell his disciples and Peter he goeth before you
into Galilee, and there shall ye see him as he said unto you”
(Mark xvi. 7); and also, “Remember how he spake unto you
when he was yet in Galilee, saying that the Son of Man
must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be
crucified, and the third day rise again” (Luke xxiv. 6, 7).
And we find that when the disciples understood the mystery
of his death, they joyfully accepted the proofs of his resurrection;
and Peter, who had said, “Be it far from thee, Lord,
this shall never be unto thee” (Matthew xvi. 23), on the day
of Pentecost could explain that Jesus (whom God had “raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
up, having loosed the pangs of death”), was delivered up to
be crucified and slain “by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
of God”; and that David spake of his resurrection.
(Acts ii. 22-31.)</p>

<p>Not only do the prophecies point to his resurrection, but
as already<a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> shown, Jesus himself foretold it as well as the
manner and circumstances of his death; and it is more
rational to accept it, than to believe that such an One as is
portrayed in the Gospels was either false or mistaken.
“Which of you convicteth me of sin?” has found none to
accept the challenge in eighteen hundred years! On the contrary,
as Dr. Taylor has said,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “Before the portraiture which
the Evangelists have painted, men of every age have stood
in rooted admiration.” And as J. S. Mill concedes,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “It is
of no use to say that Christ, as exhibited in the Gospels, is
not historical: for none of his disciples or their proselytes
were capable of inventing the sayings ascribed to him, or
imagining the life and character revealed in the Gospels.”</p>

<p>His resurrection was a moral necessity from his own character
as delineated in the Gospels, even our enemies themselves
being judges. His could not have been “the richest of
human lives,” as declared by Hooykaas,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> nor his utterances
“the most beautiful moral teaching that humanity has received,”
as avowed by Renan, if his power to lay down his
life and “to take it again” were at the best a mere delusion.</p>

<p>His predictions of his death and resurrection, as we have
before shown, are so interwoven with the entire narrative, that
it is impossible to set them aside and leave anything to which
we can assent as true, of all his recorded acts and words; and
there is no alternative except to believe that he uttered them,
or else to arbitrarily set aside the testimony of the four Evangelists,
as well as that of Paul.</p>

<p><i>That the Christ of the Gospels</i> should rise from the dead, as
he said, <i>is in the highest degree probable</i>. Only by his resurrection
could he vindicate himself from the charge of blasphemy.
Without it, the cross was a gibbet, a monument of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
folly if not of crime. Without it, the sacrament which he instituted
on the eve of his crucifixion, keeps in perpetual remembrance
the falsity of his pretensions, his impotency to save
himself from his enemies. Without it, the taunt of those
who mocked him, “He saved others, himself he cannot save,”
was merited. Without it, while one might pity him for his
sufferings, we should the more sympathize with the Sanhedrim
in protecting the people from a visionary enthusiast, if
not a wilful impostor, and inflicting (although by irregular
methods) the penalty for blasphemy expressly commanded by
the Mosaic Law.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly stated that there is no middle
ground. If he was what he claimed, his resurrection was
already assured. If he was not what he claimed, he could
not have been the exalted character eulogized by those who
deny his resurrection, and before which the world bows in
reverence.</p>

<p>If he was what he claimed, we can see a grand and
all-sufficient reason <i>why</i> God (if there <i>be</i> a God) should by
miracle give the highest possible authentication to his mission.</p>

<p>He said, “I am the light of the world;” and the world
was in darkness. He said that he came forth from God, and
he ought to show his credentials. He said he was the Son
of God, and that he always did those things that pleased
Him; which he could not do, if he set up claims destitute of
foundation. He said, “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that
whosoever believeth, may have in him eternal life. For God
so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
eternal life.”</p>

<p>The great central truths which he declared in all his teachings,
were the <i>fact</i> of sin, the need of a Saviour, and that he
is a Saviour.</p>

<p>If sin, as all experience testifies, is universal, always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
downward, and its end when finished death, the redemption
of multitudes<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> of the human race from its power to holiness,
and bliss, and endless progress, as “heirs of God, and joint
heirs with Christ,” was an object <i>worthy</i> of divine interposition,
and only an atheist should look upon such a miracle of
redemption as impossible or improbable.</p>

<p>Christ’s resurrection being established, the darkness over
the land, the rending of the veil, the coming<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> out of the
tombs, the ministry of the angels in the garden before his
betrayal, and at the sepulchre, the earthquake, the rolling
away of the stone, and the fear that came upon the watchers,
were fitting accompaniments of the transactions which they
surrounded.</p>

<p>Nor, if some of them are not mentioned by other historians,
are they overthrown, for omission is not contradiction, in
history any more than in courts. Why should Josephus, who
was not born till some years after the crucifixion, and not a
Christian, be expected to mention them? And as to Greek
and Roman writers, even Renan<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> says that “it is not surprising
that they paid little attention to a movement which
was going on within a narrow space foreign to them. Christianity
was lost to their vision upon the dark background of
Judaism.”</p>

<p>And so his being seen by Stephen the first martyr, by
John in the Apocalypse, and by Paul on the way to Damascus,
are in harmony with the record of his resurrection and
ascension, and may be said to confirm them.</p>

<p>Yet it may be questioned if Paul would have been so absolutely
certain that Jesus (against whose followers he was
breathing out threatening and slaughter) said to him, “Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?” but for the previous
appearances. If he would, he does not rest the case upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the one to himself. He gives the others first, and then adds,
“And last of all ... to me also.” While there is a mutual
support, the most solid basis for <i>our</i> belief is, in the incontrovertible
and tangible appearances which preceded Paul’s conversion;
and when John would declare the <i>certainty</i> of their
faith, he says, “That which we have heard, that which we
have seen with our eyes, that which we have beheld, and our
hands handled.” (1 John i. 1).</p>

<p>And viewing the indubitable proofs of his resurrection, in
their relation to the prophecies concerning him, the necessity
for his advent, his predictions concerning himself, his
character and works and teachings from his incarnation to
his ascension, the lives and deaths of his Apostles, the wonderful
enlargement of his little church, when the Apostles
“with great power gave their witness of the resurrection of
the Lord Jesus,” and its equally wonderful continuance, extension,
moral influence, inspirations and hopes, they rise to the
sublimity of moral certainty.</p>

<p>These things cannot rationally be accounted for unless
there is a God, and if there is a God, as all courts of justice
everywhere assume, and universal conscience declares, to
refuse assent to the conclusion to which they necessarily
lead,—the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,—cannot
be the exercise of right reason.</p>

<p>Least of all should lawyers, accustomed to weigh evidence,
refuse to believe upon the testimony of others. As Gibson,
the great chief justice of Pennsylvania, said: “Give Christianity
a common law trial; submit the evidence <i>pro</i> and
<i>con</i> to an impartial jury under the direction of a competent
court, and the verdict will assuredly be in its favor.”</p>

<p>We have not the witnesses before us; but it is every day’s
practice to prove historical facts by any approved and general
history, and such are our Gospels and Epistles; and they are
confirmed by sacraments and institutions that continue to
our times, and will continue to the end of the world.</p>

<p>Nor does the sufficiency of the proofs depend upon any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
question of the <i>precise</i> extent of the genuineness of the Gospels,
or their <i>exact</i> agreement. Men accustomed to weigh
evidence know that it is enough if the substance of the issue
is proved, and that a literal agreement is never to be expected
in honest witnesses. In all the great facts of the Resurrection,
the Gospels and the Epistles concur. This has been
found satisfactory to such standard authors in the legal profession
as Blackstone and Kent and Story, such masters of
the rules of evidence as Starkie and Greenleaf, and such
giants as Lord Brougham, John Marshall, Theophilus Parsons,
Jeremiah Mason and Daniel Webster, and many others
both of the dead and the living, and no historical event rests
on a firmer basis.</p>

<p>Some of its logical results will be suggested in the concluding
chapter.</p>

<p>An able article by Professor Robinson of the Union Theological Seminary,
N. Y., on the Nature of Our Lord’s Resurrection-body will be found
in the <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i> for 1845, p. 292. He thus distributes the opinions
on the subject: “On this subject three different opinions have prevailed
more or less at various times in the church. Some have held that
the body of Christ was changed at the resurrection as to its <i>substance</i>, so
that it was in its substance a different and spiritual body. Others have
regarded the Lord as having had after the resurrection the <i>same</i> body as
before, but glorified; or, as the earliest writers express it, changed as to
its qualities and attributes. The third and larger class have supposed that
the body with which Christ rose from the dead was the same natural body
of flesh and blood which had been taken down from the cross and laid in
the sepulchre.”</p>

<p>This article we had not read until after writing chapter 19, but our convictions
are confirmed by his thorough discussion of the subject. He concludes
that the evidence of the reality of our Lord’s human body, from the
Resurrection to the Ascension, is even stronger than that for any other
forty days, since Jesus was specially careful to assure his disciples of the
fact.</p>

<span class="smaller">LOGICAL RESULTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Of these we mention only the following:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>—Since the proofs of Christ’s Resurrection are incomparably
greater than those of any other miracle, and its
consequences are beyond conception more glorious, it is the
part of wisdom to force the issue upon it. The decisive battle
of the world in respect to the miraculous in Christianity is
to be fought right here, and all other engagements are mere
skirmishes. It is well it is so. Christ’s Resurrection is our
Gibraltar. If we cannot hold this position, we cannot hold
any. But we do hold it, and with it the whole field of controversy
upon the subject. Let any one who doubts or denies
the reality of miracles, meet the overwhelming proofs of this
the greatest of all miracles. If he cannot do it, he should
yield; and it is no dishonor to be vanquished by the truth.
If, after examining these proofs, he still imagines that he can
overcome them, he is beyond the reach of argument.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>—As it is the central fact of Christianity, the keystone
in the arch of the Christian Faith, those who reject it
have no right to the Christian name. Strauss is so far to be
commended that, when by his myths and sophistries he had
brought himself to deny the one, he had the manliness not to
appropriate the other. And of those of his fellows who still
cling to it for its supposed advantages, he sarcastically says:
“Reasons they may have, but reason they have none.” Chadwick,
Hooykaas, Miln, Savage and others,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who talk of their
“Church of the Future,” may well follow his example. If
they refuse, there is as little sense as piety in a recognition,
or <i>quasi</i> recognition, of them as ministers of the Gospel, when
at the best they are only popular lecturers to mere social or
literary, if not infidel clubs, that choose to be called Churches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
or Religious Societies. This no doubt is distasteful to those
who are looking for the time when all sects shall fraternize
on a common level of skepticism and indifference. But if we
have any colors we should stand by them. Fidelity to truth
and to the Master requires a separation uncompromising and
complete from all who deny Him. It is safe to be as tolerant
as Jesus and his Apostles. (See John viii. 21; 2 Corinthians
vi. 14, 15; Revelation i. 4, 5; 1 Corinthians xv. 16, 17, 18;
1 John ii. 12, 23; 1 Peter i. 3, 4; 2 Peter ii. 1, 2; Revelation
ii. 6; Acts v. 30-33; Acts iv. 11, 12.)</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>—It authenticates his mission and vindicates his
claims to the utmost. By it God affixed the seal of his
approval, and evermore declares as by a voice from heaven,
“This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased: hear
ye Him.”</p>

<p>His teachings are no longer opinions to be accepted or rejected
as they meet with our approval, but authoritative and
final. They are not the speculations of sages and philosophers,
either of olden or recent times, to be weighed in
the balance of human reason, but everlasting truth to be received
and obeyed without doubting or questioning.</p>

<p>Since Christ’s resurrection is assured, Webster well declared,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
as every man in the exercise of right reason must, “I
hold it my duty to believe, not what I can comprehend or
account for, but what my Master teaches me.”</p>

<p>By this, of course, it is not intended that we are not to exercise
our reason as to the genuineness of the teachings ascribed
to him, or their proper meaning, or, in other words, as to textuality,
inspiration, translation, and interpretation. In each of
these departments there is and will be ample room for the
greatest research, and the ripest scholarship. In respect to
all these, is doubtless true now, as when spoken by Robinson,
that, “The Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his
holy word.”</p>

<p>But when in a teachable spirit, we know what Jesus taught,
it is the end of controversy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>—A necessary consequence from his Resurrection
must be an undoubted assurance that we have the means of
knowing what his teachings were, so far as they are essential
to our guidance in this life and preparation for that which is
to come. The very idea of a revelation is that it shall be so
made known, that it can be understood, trusted in, and
obeyed, by those to whom it is given, and for whom it is intended,
so far at least, as shall be necessary for the regulation
of their own conduct.</p>

<p><i>Beyond this</i>, we cannot claim, as a logical result of Christ’s
Resurrection, and do not now inquire. And we find that
through all the years since our Lord’s ascension, while the
church has had essential truth, and there has been substantial<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
agreement in different copies and versions, there have
always been and still are, unsolved questions of genuineness,
translation, interpretation, and inspiration. In respect to the
last, Ingersoll’s demand<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that if the writers of the Gospels
were inspired there should be but one account, or, if more
than one, there should be <i>no</i> contradiction, is unwarrantable;
and his own concession proves it. “As a rule,” he says,
“where several persons testify to the same transaction, while
agreeing in the main points they will disagree upon many
minor things, and such disagreement upon minor matters is
generally considered as evidence that the witnesses have not
agreed among themselves upon the story they should tell.
These differences in statement are accounted for from the
facts that all did not see alike, and that all did not have the
same opportunity for seeing, and that all had not equally good
memories. But when we claim that the witnesses were inspired,
we admit that he who inspired them did know exactly
what occurred, and consequently there should be no contradiction
in the minutest detail.” This is very poor logic. For
although “He who inspired” did know exactly what occurred,
there may have been the best of reasons for not inspiring a
full record of all that occurred, or an exact record in all respects
of what is recorded; and it must be presumed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
such an inspiration would be given as would be most conducive
to the end in view. And a like answer disposes of his
confident assertion, that “<i>one</i> inspired record of all that happened
ought to be enough.” <i>He</i> would have Divine wisdom
sacrifice everything else for the sake of uniformity and precise
accuracy in incidental and immaterial matters. In other
words he would tithe “mint and anise and cummin,” at the
expense of “weightier matters.” The Gospels were separately
written at different times, according to the needs in the first instance
of the particular classes for which they were immediately
intended, and ultimately for the wants of the whole world.
Each by itself was as complete and accurate as it was best
it should be; and the whole taken together are as full and
exact, as it is best they should be. And looking beyond the
particular classes to whom they were first given, to all generations
and peoples, it was of supreme importance that they
should be <i>believed</i>; and in order to this, that they should be
so written as not to carry suspicion of collusion or fabrication
upon their face. Mr. Ingersoll knows that the testimony of
four witnesses agreeing in the main points, while differing in
minor matters, is more satisfactory than the testimony of one.
If there were nothing to be counted but numbers, the evidence
would be four times as strong. It is more than four
times as strong. For, as Mr. Starkie says,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and every lawyer
knows, “The credibility of testimony frequently depends
upon the exercise of reason, on the effect of <i>coincidences in
testimony</i>, which, if collusion be excluded, cannot be accounted
for but upon the supposition that the testimony of
concurring witnesses is true; so much so that their individual
character for veracity is frequently but of secondary importance.”
But to have this effect it is <i>indispensable</i> that <i>collusion</i>
be excluded. And it is of vastly greater consequence
that we be certain that we have (as it is conceded we have)
independent accounts of the crucifixion than it is, for instance,
that the inscriptions over the cross as given by the
four Evangelists should precisely agree, or that either should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
have been the exact words that were written. In fact, while
they all agree that the accusation was “<i>The King of the
Jews</i>” (which is all that is material), no two of them agree
with each other. But as Professor Greenleaf says, no greater
certainty is called for. “The same<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> verbal exactness is
not necessary in historians whose aim is religious instruction,
as in recorders of public inscriptions.”</p>

<p>If but one account, there would be the absence of that personality
and variety, which we now have, and more especially
the want of that conclusive proof which comes from independent
witnesses.</p>

<p>If the Gospels had been written as Mr. Ingersoll says they
should have been if inspired, the objections against them, if
not insurmountable, would have been tenfold stronger. And
why should not Divine wisdom so inspire as to secure the best
possible results? And although two of the writers were
Apostles, and to the Apostles was the Holy Spirit given to
teach them “all things,” and bring to their remembrance “all
things” which Jesus had said unto them (John xiv. 26), this
does not necessarily imply an exact transmission of all the
words spoken. Regard should be had to the substance of
things in this, as in other matters, and not to mere verbal
accuracy, except in those rare cases in which it is important
to know the precise language used.</p>

<p>It may safely be affirmed that there is <i>no</i> discrepancy in
relation to any essential fact, or important doctrine or duty.
And it is just this degree of certainty and accuracy, that we
should expect from our Lord’s true Messiahship as proved by
his Resurrection.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>.—By it, we know that he had power to impart to his
Apostles to whom he entrusted the establishment of his
church, and to Paul whom he especially selected as an Apostle
to the Gentiles, inspiration and the gift of miracles. As
the Father sent him into the world, even so he sent them
into the world (John xviii. 18); and what things soever they
should bind, or loose, on earth, should be bound or loosed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
in heaven (Luke xxi. 14-16). Miracles were attestations of
their Apostleship, “God also bearing witness with them, both
by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers and by gifts of
the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.” (Hebrews ii. 4.)</p>

<p>With the writings of John the volume of inspiration was
complete. If any miracles were wrought after his time
(which is questioned by many<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>), there are none sufficiently
authenticated to be of any evidential value to us.</p>

<p>But there is in every true Church, and will be to the end
of time, what is of greater importance than the working of
miracles, the convicting and transforming power of the Holy
Ghost; and any community, by whatever name it may be
called, that has not this attestation is not a true Church of the
Lord Jesus Christ. The promise of the Comforter who shall
“convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment;”
and “Lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world,” are as immutable as the throne of God.</p>

<p>If the Gospel had been only a “civilization,” as Mr. Chadwick
terms it, it had never been known outside of Judea. It
is because it is the “wisdom of God, and the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth,” that it has gained
its marvellous victories, overturning Pagan Rome, and in
these later days transforming even Madagascar, the Sandwich
Islands, and the cannibals<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the Fiji Islands into Christian
communities.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>.—In our conception of Jesus as our Saviour, we
should not separate his death from his resurrection and ascension.
If he died for our sins, he rose again for our justification.
He is now exalted as a Prince and a Saviour at the right
hand of the Father, to give repentance and the remission of
sins. United to him by faith, and changed into his image,
our resurrection is assured by his, and because he lives we
shall live also. As oft as we “eat this bread and drink
this cup,” we do show forth his death <span class="smcap">till he come</span>.
“Henceforth,” (said<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the great Apostle) “there is laid up
for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
righteous judge, shall give to me at that day, and not only
to me, <i>but also to all them that leave loved his appearing</i>.”
“And<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and he that
heareth let him say, Come; and he that is athirst let him
come; he that will, let him take the water of Life freely.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="label">[1]</a> It is one of the marvels of sin and shows the effrontery of Satan, that
Hooykaas, who is about as rank an infidel as Strauss himself, should be
pastor at Rotterdam, a Doctor of Divinity, and entitle his book, which
laboriously excludes everything miraculous or supernatural in relation to
Jesus, “The Bible for Learners.” Mr. Chadwick, while admitting that he
is not a Christian in the original sense of the word, argues against Strauss
(with whom he agrees in sentiment) the right to apply the term to himself,
but meaning by it only “a stream of tendency,” “freedom, progress and
civilization.” “It may be,” he says, “that some of you conceive that my
definition of Christianity does worse than include those who are at pains
to prove themselves not Christians. It includes the dangerous classes of
society; it includes the men of vice and crime. There is no doubt of it.”
(See <i>Free Religious Index</i> for March 17, 1881, March 24, 1881, and March
31, 1881.) Mr. Miln recently <i>preached a sermon</i> upon “The Church of
the Future,” from which he said all speculative beliefs as a condition of
membership will be excluded, even the belief in a personal Deity. (See
<i>Index</i> for February 23, 1882.) He does not believe in prayer other than
communion with himself. (See <i>New York Observer</i> of February 23, 1882.)
If Mr. Savage has not yet gone as far, he stops but little short of it.</p>

Church of Salisbury, New Hampshire. He joined this church on profession
of faith September 13, 1807, and never removed his connection. (See

<p><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="label">[7]</a> History of God’s Church, by Enoch Pond, D.D., p. 606. And as to
Judge Waite’s “many cases of resurrection from the dead, handed down in
the ancient mythologies” and by heathen writers, it will be soon enough
to notice them whenever there shall be a serious attempt to run a parallel
between the evidence in support of them, and that which proves the resurrection
of our Lord. And so of the whole swarm of lying wonders,
whether found in heathen writers, the Apocryphal Gospels, or exhibited by
modern conjurors or spiritualists,—senseless, frivolous, for no worthy
object, and, beyond the mystery accompanying them, supported by no reasonable
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">proof. Our Saviour told his disciples “beforehand” that “there</span><br />
shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and
wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.” (Matthew xxiv.
24.) Paul told Timothy that “the Spirit saith expressly that in later
times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits
and doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisies of men that speak lies,
branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron.” (1 Timothy iv. 1,
2.) This will be strange to any modern Sadducee who believes there is
“neither angel nor Spirit,” but the Christian will do well to give heed.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">[8]</a> Within the last thirty years, through the labors of English Wesleyan
missionaries, there has been an entire moral renovation of cannibals, once
revelling and rioting in every excess of atrocity and bestial shame. Now
there are nine thousand churches and thousands of communicants, fourteen
thousand schools and nearly fifty thousand scholars: and out of a population
of about one hundred and twenty thousand, over one hundred thousand
are reckoned as regular attendants at the churches. Cannibalism has
been voluntarily abandoned, save by a single tribe, in eighty inhabited
islands: idolatry has been abjured, and all traces of it swept away. And
to-day a gentle and refined English woman, as Miss Gordon-Cumming in
her book, At Home in Fiji, testifies, can travel these islands alone,
mingling with the people, rambling through their villages, sleeping in
their huts and eating at their tables, with none to molest her or make her
afraid. (See Rev. Edward Abbott, in <i>Congregationalist</i> of February 15,
1882.)</p>

Religion.</b> By <span class="smcap">Thomas Erskine</span>, Esq., Advocate. Third American,
from the Fifth Edinburgh Edition. 16mo. 75 cents.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The entire treatise cannot fail to commend the positions which it advocates to
intelligent and considerate minds. It is one of the best, perhaps <i>the</i> best, of all
the discussions of this momentous subject.”—<i>Congregationalist.</i></p>

<p>“This argument of Erskine for the Internal Evidence of the Truth of Revealed
Religion, is the most compact, natural, and convincing we have ever read from
any author.”—<i>Christian Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“No man ought to consider himself as having studied theology unless he has read
and pondered and read again ‘Erskine on the Internal Evidence.’”—<i>Independent.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><b>Five Discourses on St. Paul.</b> To which is added a Discourse on
Fatalism. By <span class="smcap">Adolphe Monod</span>. Translated from the French
by Rev. <span class="smcap">J. H. Myers</span>, D.D. 12mo. 90 cents.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The aim of the author is to present an estimate of the character, labors, and
writings of the Apostle Paul in the light of an example, and to apply the principles
which actuated him, and which he maintained, to Christians of the present day.”—<i>Boston
Journal.</i></p>

<p>“A book unsurpassed in its department, in any language, for manly eloquence,
thorough research, profound reflection, a most earnest, glowing, winning Christian
spirit, united with an exact appreciation of the great Apostle’s character and work,
and a wise, cautious, but bold and unflinching, application of his teachings to the
times in which we live.”—<i>The Translator.</i></p>

<p>“A masterly and most eloquent delineation of the inner life of the great Apostle.”—<i>Evangelical
Quarterly.</i></p>

12mo. Cloth extra, gilt tops. $1.50</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Dr. Whately’s writings are characterized by sound thought and solid judgment.
Clear and solid sense is his peculiar characteristic. He is often ingenious, generally
candid, almost always plain and transparent.”—<i>Bibliotheca Sacra.</i></p>

<p>“An excellent work.”—<i>New York Evangelist.</i></p>

<p>“The Archbishop’s writings are a part of the sterling theological letters of the
age, and ought to be possessed by all the studious and thoughtful.”—<i>Journal and
Messenger.</i></p>

<p>“This book had passed through at least eight editions in England before its
publication in this country. Dr. Whately is always entitled to a hearing. Never
profound, he is always clear; never very original, he is always instructive; never
disgustingly dogmatic, he always seems to feel a serene assurance that he has
exhausted the whole subject, and that his verdict is final; always positive and
didactic, he is yet never extreme, but always takes the middle and moderate view.”—<i>Watchman
and Reflector.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><b>Historic Doubts concerning Napoleon.</b> 12mo. Paper covers.
25 cents; cloth, 40 cents.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>About the year 1821 Whately published this Essay anonymously. It was
designed as an answer to Hume’s objections to the credibility of the Christian
miracles. Following Hume’s method, Whately gravely argued the improbability
of the existence of the first Napoleon, and demonstrated that, on Hume’s principles,
the testimony in relation thereto could not be credited.</p>

<p class="hanging"><b>The Contemplations and Letters of Henry Dorney of Uley,
Gloucestershire.</b> 12mo. $1.00</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The Contemplations and Letters of Henry Dorney were held in high estimation
by Madam Phebe Phillips. The copy which she used, came down to her as an
heirloom from her pious ancestors, and was ranked, on her private table, next to
her Bible and hymn-book. So highly did she esteem the work, that she copied
out, with her own hand, a large part of the volume for the use of a friend. It
is now reprinted as a precious memorial of one of the honored founders of the
Theological Institution.</p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><b>Bible History of Prayer.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. A. Goodrich</span>. 12mo. $1.25</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The aim of this little volume is to embody an account of the delightful and
successful intercourse of believers with heaven for some four thousand years. The
author has indulged a good deal in narrative, opening and explaining the circumstances
which gave birth to the several prayers.</p>

<p>“The author does not aim to write a treatise on prayer, or to comment on all the
references to prayer in chronological order, but to dwell on its nature and importance,
and make suggestions on the most important allusions to prayer, as indicated
all along for four thousand years. He explains the circumstances connected
with the prayers of these holy men.”—<i>Religious Union.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><b>Messianic Prophecy and the Life of Christ.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">W. S.
Kennedy</span>. 12mo. $1.25</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The plan of the author is to collect all the prophecies of the Old Testament
referring to the Messiah, with appropriate comments and reflections, and then to
pursue the subject through the New Testament in the life of Christ as he appeared
among men. The reader will find the results of Hengstenberg and Neander here
gathered up, and presented in a readable shape.”—<i>The Presbyterian.</i></p>

<p>“This work exhibits the prophetic element in the Messianic argument in an
analytical shape, and with peculiar force.”—<i>Episcopal Recorder.</i></p>

<p>“The general idea of the book is a very happy one, and it has, on the whole
been well wrought out.”—<i>The Lutheran.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This treatise was discovered by Luther, who first brought it into notice by an
edition which he published in 1516, of which he says: “And I will say, though it
be boasting of myself, and ‘I speak as a fool,’ that, next to the Bible and St.
Augustine, no book hath ever come into my hands whence I have learnt, or
would wish to learn, more of what God and Christ, and man, and all things, are.”
“A precious lump of pure gold in a flag of earth and stone.”</p>

<p>“This little volume which is brought out in antique style, is, apart from its
intrinsic value, a curiosity of literature. It may be regarded as the harbinger of
the Protestant Reformation. No fewer than seventeen editions of this book appeared
in his lifetime, and up to the present day it has continued to be a favorite
manual of devotion in Germany, where it has passed through certainly as many
as sixty editions.”—<i>Evening Traveller.</i></p>

<p>“I value it <i>exceedingly</i>, so vivid and so rich is it, on the great ideas of <i>sin</i>, and
<i>salvation through Christ</i>.”—<i>Congregational Herald.</i></p>

Crown 8vo. pp. xii and 473. $1.75</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><b>From Professor Edwards A. Park.</b>—“I do not know any volume which
gives to the English reader such a compressed amount of suggestion and instruction
on this theme as is given in this volume.”</p>

<p><b>From the Presbyterian Quarterly.</b>—“The book is honest, candid, and
painstaking. It will be found useful to all students of the sacred volume.”</p>

<p>“An able book, containing a clear and dispassionate discussion of a momentous
subject. It stands unique in a field of its own.”—<i>Independent.</i></p>

<p>“As an example of thorough and painstaking scholarship, as a serviceable handbook
for all Bible students, and as a popular defence of revealed truth, it will take
high rank, and fill an important place which up to this time has been conspicuously
vacant.”—<i>Congregationalist.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“It presents, in a calm and admirable manner, the Scriptural doctrine of future
retribution, divested, indeed, of the literalism with which it is sometimes presented,
and showing its accordance with the deductions of a sound philosophy.”—<i>Zion’s
Herald.</i></p>

<p>“It is a scholarly, clear, dispassionate, and conclusive argument in favor of what
is known as the common or orthodox view of future punishment. The whole discussion
is conducted in a spirit of courtesy and fairness towards all opponents
which does credit to our current controversial literature.”—<i>The Interior.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i><b>Wright. The Logic of Christian Evidences.</b></i> By Rev. G. Frederick
Wright. 16mo. $1.50</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Beginning with a general statement of the principles of inductive and deductive
logic, which are illustrated by ample examples drawn from the whole field of
modern science, it advances to the consideration of the personality, wisdom, and
benevolence of the Creator, as seen in nature; to the place of miracles in the Christian
system; to the specific evidences of Christianity as discerned in the early history
of the New Testament, and in the characteristics of the Christians of the first
and second centuries; and to the historical probability of Jesus and his immediate
followers having been either impostors or deluded enthusiasts.”—<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“The book would form an admirable text-book for Bible-classes or college classes,
and will give solid comfort and strength to all readers who have any desire to be
able to give a reason for believing.”—<i>Rev. Dr. Thomas Hill in the Bibliotheca Sacra.</i></p>

Wright, author of “The Logic of Christian Evidences.” 16mo. $1.50</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The chapter on inductive reasoning, with which the book opens, is as full, explanatory,
and convincing as any one could wish, despite the fact it occupies only
twenty-six pages.... The grand point contended for and carried is that ‘Christianity,
in its appeal to historical evidence, allies itself with modern science rather
than with the glittering generalities of transcendentalism,’ and that in its beginnings
science has no advantage over religion in solidity of basis.”—<i>The Leader.</i></p>

<p>“The article on Prehistoric Man, now appears for the first time. It is illustrated
by a number of maps and cuts which enhance the interest of the story. The
southern limit of the ice of the Glacial Epoch in North America is traced, and the
connection of human implements therewith is shown.”—<i>Oberlin Review.</i></p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
